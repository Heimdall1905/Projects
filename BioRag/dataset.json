    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the predominant cause of dementia worldwide, and the number of patients with dementia is estimated to reach 75 million by 2030 [1]. AD is a multifactorial, heterogeneous, and progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by a lengthy pre-clinical phase. Amyloidβ (A β )-proteopathy is the crucial early impetus for the disease [2-4]. The FDA's approval of several anti-A β drugs (Aducanumab and Lecanemab) for clinical use provides significant achievements for both basic research and clinical investigations on AD [5].The pathological hallmarks of AD in the brain are extracellular A β plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau-formed neurofibrillary tangles, and significant neuron loss [6,7]. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified the AD risk genes associated with innate immune functions as well as elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in AD patients, which suggests that neuroinflammation plays a prominent role in the pathology of AD [8-10].

Proliferated and activated microglia concentrated around amyloid plaques are another prominent histopathological change in AD [13]. In AD, microglia have a 'double-edged sword' effect, displaying both neuroprotective and neurotoxic functions depending on the disease stage and contextual factors [14]. During the early stages of AD, activated microglia primarily exert protective effects by eliminating A β plaques through phagocytosis and the release of proteases, as well as engulfing dead cell debris [15]. Additionally, they may adopt alternative reactive states to counteract A β -induced cytotoxicity toward neighboring neurons or synapses [16] and create a physical barrier that inhibits plaque spread [17]. However, in the later stages of AD, compromised A β clearance and tau accumulation impair microglial defense functions. The dysfunction of microglia is continuously stimulated by the abundance and size of plaques, resulting in an overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines that are toxic to nearby astrocytes and neurons (see Figure 1). These findings underscore microglia as potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this review, we initially delve into the pivotal role played by microglia in AD pathogenesis. Subsequently, we focus on therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing microglial phagocytic function and regulating neuroinflammation, including both molecular-based drugs and natural products.

    "conclusion": "Extensive research highlights microglia's significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent single-cell analyses reveal distinct microglial phenotypes, advancing our understanding of their functions in AD [9]. Microglia play complex and sometimes contradictory roles-they can limit A β and tau spread by engulfing these proteins, yet may also accelerate their diffusion, promoting AD progression. Despite the extensive research on advanced AD stages, investigations into preclinical and early stages remain inadequate. Early detection and treatment are crucial due to the lack of curative interventions for this devastating disease [163]. Understanding microglia's dynamic state and dominant role at different AD stages is essential for precise therapeutic strategies. To address translatability concerns, we must differentiate microglial activity observed in animal models from that in AD patients [164,165]. While transgenic mouse models dominate the research, their differences from human microglia raise questions about applicability. Novel model systems, such as those derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells [7,166] or chimeric mouse models [167], offer promising solutions. Ongoing clinical trials investigating microglia-related drugs will yield new evidence for AD immunotherapy. Additionally, natural products with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects present potential targets for AD drug therapy. Further research into the causal relationship between microglia-related neuroinflammation and AD pathogenesis remains an exciting avenue for innovative therapeutic approaches.

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative disease known to cause dementia in the elderly [1, 2], contributing to 60-70% of all dementia cases [3, 4] that have affected more than 37 million people across the globe. The massiveness of the economic burden of AD and other dementias can be determined by the fact that the annual patient care cost in 2021 in the United States alone was a minimum of $355 billion [5]. It is further estimated that by 2050, these costs could rise to as high as $1.1 trillion. Moreover, more than 6 million Americans are living with AD. By 2050, this number is projected to grow to nearly 13 million [6]. Besides, AD is one of the top 10 primary reasons for death in the United States [4]. It is also pertinent to mention that the mortalities due to AD are more than those from prostate and breast cancer combined [6]. Figure 1 shows the percentage of AD prevalence among different age groups of 65 and above [7]. Unfortunately, except for the recent approval of Aducanumab and Lecanemab, both antiamyloid antibodies associated with significant adverse effects, other FDA-approved drugs are ineffective in preventing or reversing this disease and only provide modest symptomatic benefits [3]. Motivated by the unequivocal need and growing understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of AD, a dramatic increase has been observed in developing many entities to bring a solution to the table. It is also interesting to note that 'disease-modifying' treatments that aim at the fundamental mechanisms of AD have now touched the late stages of human clinical trials. The details of ongoing clinical trials are presented in the last section of this review. Formation of A β aggregates (by amyloidogenic pathway [2]), neurofibrillary tangles (abnormal tau-protein accumulation due to faulty proteostasis [8]), and destruction of cortical cholinergic neurons are the characteristic features of AD [9-11]. The other factors that cause AD [12] include excitotoxicity, autoimmune responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, excessively high calcium levels, and mitophagy [13]. These events are attributed to genetic makeup, environmental factors [14, 15], and molecular interactions [16]. Over the years, scientists have been trying to identify the hidden clues of the disease at the genetic level. Eventually, these findings would help humanity avoid the inevitable signs and symptoms of the disease, such as dementia, confusion, difficulty in understanding situations, inability to solve problems, losing personal belongings, social isolation, and uncontrolled emotions [17]. Several small molecules have been investigated to manage this disease at its best; however, a disease-modifying definitive cure is yet a quest of scientists across the globe. Almost all small molecule drugs approved or investigated in AD aim to provide symptomatic relief. They either reduce the severity of the disease to improve quality of life or slow down neurodegeneration. With respect to the anti-amyloid antibodies recently approved for AD, though both the anti-amyloid antibodies reduce brain amyloid, the effect of slowing clinical disease progression remains questionable or modest[18]. Additional work is needed to determine if the anti-amyloid antibodies result in a clinical meaningful effect[18]. Further, the existing therapies cause several side effects that compromise AD therapy. Figure 2 describes the overview of AD drugs and their side effects. Therefore, newer personalized treatment strategies need to be developed that target the underlying cause of the illness, with precision, without compromising safety and cost-effectiveness. Gene therapy using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can serve as an avenue in this regard. siRNAs are non-coding RNAs with no more than 20-24 nucleotides in length that can cause post-transcriptional silencing of the desired gene. Their mechanism of action is based on microRNAs that are naturally produced in the body and play an essential role in regulating gene expression [19, 20]. Recently, a review was published on recent advances for AD [21], and another review highlighted the role of siRNA nanocarriers in neurodegenerative diseases [22]. However, to our understanding, no comprehensive review delineates the advances in nucleic acid-based therapeutics, particularly siRNA for AD. This review aims to identify the siRNA target genes implicated in AD and to provide the readers with the latest advances in AD therapeutics, focusing on AD pathology and the carriers that cross the blood-brain barrier. We have thoroughly discussed the latest developments in treating AD. We rigorously describe the latest siRNA-based in-vitro and in-vivo studies that point toward the future of AD therapy. Finally, we explain the challenges and opportunities for the concerned scientific community.",
    "conclusion": "AD is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects a vast population and poses a massive economic burden on healthcare systems across the globe. The approach to solving this challenging health condition has largely been to mitigate the symptoms and increase the quality of life of the affected patients. However, with disease-modifying agents such as Aducanumab and Lecanemab receiving approval, the FDA approval of nucleic acid-based-therapeutics, a growing in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms, identification of molecular targets, and successful reversal of AD symptoms in mice models are shifting the paradigm in addressing the neurodegenerative disorders. Although more than two dozen pharmaceutical companies are investing colossal capital, government agencies need more funding to investigate this exciting area of research to result in successful and cost-effective therapies for the AD-affected population. Observing the trend in the past two decades of research and the success achieved in this area of research, we can safely conclude that the next decade will witness a plethora of nucleic-acid-based therapeutics, particularly the siRNA-based products that will be cost-effective and will be far better in efficacy compared to the existing small molecule-based therapies."

[ 1] Although the BBB is essential for maintaining proper functioning of the CNS, it also poses challenges for the treatment of neurological disorders (NDs). The emergence of nanotechnology has largely overcome this problem. However, most strategies are based on chemical engineering modifications, whichmayleadtopoorbiocompatibility. [2-5] Few studies have designed cell membranecoated nanoparticles to enhance compatibility and safety. [ 6] The potential of using platelet membranes as transporters is attractive, due to their ability to flow through destructive blood vessels, concurrently elongating circulation duration. [ 7,8] In addition to single-cell membranecoated nanotechnology, hybrid nanoparticles derived from multiple cell types make precise targeting possible. [9,10] Neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various NDs. [11,12] The activation of glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, is a central feature of neuroinflammation in the CNS. These glial cells can produce and release a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, which can cause damage to neurons and contribute to the pathogenesis of NDs.

The drugs were released to enhance autophagy, alleviate neuroinflammation and ultimately treat AD. <!-- image --> sources, is important. [ 14] CCL2 has been found to be upregulated in response to various neurological insults. [ 15-17] This cytokine effectively recruits cells expressing its cognate receptor, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2), to a/uniFB04icted regions, thereby augmenting the potential for targeted intervention. Motivated by these insights, our current focus is on designing a bioengineered cell membrane characterized by CCR2, a configuration tailored to facilitate drug accumulation in inflammation-related lesions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Notably, neuroinflammation is among the foremost events in AD pathogenesis. [18-20] CCL2 secretion is increased in ADpatients and animal models. [21,22] Therefore, the use of membranes with high expression of CCR2 for precise targeting of early-stage lesions is a novel strategy for the e/uniFB00ective treatment of AD. Intriguingly, concurrent pathological changes in AD, such as the emergence of amyloid plaques, tau pathology, and neuronal degeneration frequently cooccur with neuroinflammation, forging a reinforcing interplay. Considering the multifaceted nature of AD and lessons from past unsuccessful attempts to develop drugs for AD, a combination of medications targeting di/uniFB00erent mechanisms is more advantageous than a single-drug approach. [23] Nanocarriers provide an opportunity not only to optimize dosing regimens but also to improve the e/uniFB00ectiveness of multidrug therapies. In AD, a decrease in autophagy leads to an inability to clear away harmful proteins, resulting in neuronal death and glial cell activation, and ultimately triggering the development of a complex neuroinflammatory environment. [13,24] Several studies have demonstrated that rapamycin is a potential small molecule for enhancing autophagy and reducing the burden of pathological proteins in AD. [24,25] However, its extremely low BBB pass rate limits its clinical application. [ 26] In addition, to align the carrier's function with targeting inflammatory lesions, we considered adding another drug that can inhibit neuroinflammation to improve the extracellular environment. 1-Trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), has been reported to prevent glial cell reactivation and alleviate cognitive deficits in the brains of AD mice. [27] These results suggest that TPPU may be a potent candidate for encapsulation. Based on the above considerations, we proposed an original strategy that uses nanotechnology ( Figure 1 ). We developed a hybridization system by combining a platelet membrane and a membrane with high expression of CCR2, and loaded two small molecule drugs (rapamycin and TPPU) on these hybrid liposomes, to target and treat pathological areas in the brain associated with AD. <!-- image --> www.advancedsciencenews.com <!-- image --> www.advancedscience.com Figure 2.

    "conclusion": "In this study, we innovatively designed a hybrid liposomal system enveloped in cell membrane coatings to treat AD. Our investigation was focused on two primary objectives. Initially, we elucidated the potential of this novel nanocarrier for precisely targeting inflammatory lesions within the brain through e/uniFB03cient BBB <!-- image --> www.advancedscience.com traversal. Subsequently, our research successfully encapsulated two separate therapeutic agents, rapamycin and TPPU, within hybrid cell membrane-coated liposomes, thereby facilitating a synergistic and multitargeted therapeutic strategy against AD. The results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments have conclusively demonstrated the remarkable therapeutic potential of drug-loaded hybrid cell-membrane liposomes in the treatment of AD. Our findings indicate that the hybrid cell-membrane-coated liposome system has the potential to develop e/uniFB00ective, precise and multitargeted treatments for AD. This opens the door to more e/uniFB00ective treatment regimens and the potential for more personalized therapeutic strategies. In recent years, the development of nanomaterials has revolutionized the field of medicine, particularly in the treatment of CNS diseases. [28] Among the various nanotechnologies, cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CM-NPs) have emerged as a promising approach for targeted therapy. CM-NPs combine the benefits of both synthetic nanoparticles and natural cell membranes, o/uniFB00ering enhanced biocompatibility, prolonged circulation time, and improved targeting ability. [ 29] In the context of AD, these nanoparticles have shown great potential in overcoming BBB impermeability and delivering therapeutic agents specifically to a/uniFB00ected brain regions. [ 30] Among the cell membranes, the erythrocyte membrane is the most frequently used in AD therapy. [ 31-33] Recent studies have also designed cell membrane camouflage nanosystems from microglial BV2 cells [34] and macrophages [35] against AD. There is still a lack of therapeutic strategies for AD using platelet membranes as coatings. Theoretically, the platelet membrane has considerable advantages as a coating in the application of AD treatment. First, the platelet membrane expresses various membrane proteins. The presence of CD47 on the platelet membrane surface enables it to interact with signaling regulatory proteins on immune cells and inhibit immune cell-mediated clearance of CM-NPs, [36] thereby prolonging the circulation of nanomedicine. Platelets also express unique surface ligands for targeting tissues or cells, especially damaged vascular systems. In the damaged vascular system, glycoprotein Ib/V /IX and von Willebrand factor bind to exposed collagen to form complexes, and platelets can initiate the coagulation process by binding to these complexes through integrins. [37] Our results demonstrated that multiple integrins are expressed on the surface of mouse platelet membranes and can migrate around damaged blood vessels. The destruction of the BBB in AD is essentially a type of microvascular injury, which suggests that platelet membranes can pass through the BBB. As shown by the biodistribution analysis, cell-membrane hybrid liposomes with a higher proportion of platelet membranes had a greater BBB penetration rate. In addition to single cell membrane coated nanotechnology, several strategies have been employed to coat synthetic nanoparticles with cell membranes derived from di/uniFB00erent cell types, such as erythrocytes, neural stem cells, and macrophages. These hybrid nanoparticles can e/uniFB00ectively mimic the surface properties and functionalities of source cells, enabling them to selectively interact with target cells or tissues. [ 9,10] However, research on the use of hybrid cell membrane-coated nanoparticles for the treatment of neurological disorders (NDs) is still in its early stages. To date, kinds of hemocytes have been hybridized with cancer cells and applied to brain tumors.

Furthermore, these nanodelivery systems are designed with wild-type glial cell lines (C6 cell line, U251 cell line etc.) and are applied to target tumors through an isotypic targeting mechanism. Due to di/uniFB00erences in pathological environments, tailoring characteristic biofilms through biological modification may be an important research subject for CM-NPs. Advances in cell isolation techniques and engineering approaches have facilitated the development of more sophisticated cell membrane-coated nanomaterials. [42] These advancements allow for the incorporation of additional factors with specific functionalities, such as specific ligands, antibodies, or imaging agents, onto the nanoparticle surface. This further enhances their targeting precision, therapeutic e/uniFB03cacy, and diagnostic capabilities. Here, we constructed a bioengineered cell membrane that overexpressed CCR2 and achieved inflammatory targeting in vivo. Although autologous microglia, astrocytes and neurons can express CCR2 on the membrane, [43] our strategy may have several advantages. Compared to that of primary cells, the reproducibility of such engineered cells is superior. In addition, the expression abundance of the target protein can be greatly increased by lentivirus transfection. And another point is that primary cells are more sensitive and changeable. For example, there are two phenotypes of microglia, M1 and M2. At the same time, the two phenotypes can transform into each other under certain conditions. [ 44] Microglia in the M1 state can promote the progression of disease, [ 45,46] while in the M2 state they function against neuroinflammation. [47] However, it is di/uniFB03cult to distinguish and retain beneficial cell-membranes in vitro, which makes this strategy di/uniFB03cult. Nevertheless, despite the substantial progress made, challenges remain. The scalability and reproducibility of cellmembrane coating methods need to be improved to meet clinical demands. The engineered extraction of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from cells may provide some insights. A recent study revealed that microglial macrosomes reduce the amyloid burden and ameliorate AD, but microsomes have completely opposite e/uniFB00ects. [ 48] It is important to note whether the original cell membranes or EVs are damaged during preparation. Furthermore, the long-term safety and potential immunogenicity of these nanomaterials must be thoroughly evaluated. In addition to the nanocarrier, the encapsulated component is also important. For a long time, AD has been regarded as the most di/uniFB03cult 'fortress' in the pharmaceutical research. [ 49] At present, the first-line drugs used to treat AD mainly include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil) [ 50] and glutamate receptor antagonists (memantine). [51] Such drugs can improve cognition in early AD patients, but cannot cure the disease. Over the past few years, the research and development of single drug treatments for AD have repeatedly failed. These findings indicate that the therapeutic e/uniFB03cacy of single drug treatments is poor. Here, we loaded two di/uniFB00erent drugs into hybrid cell membranecoated liposomes for multitargeted therapy against AD. The use of multiple drugs with distinct mechanisms of action synergistic e/uniFB00ects and addresses the multifaceted nature of AD pathology. For instance, one drug may target the accumulation of amyloid plaques, while the other may focus on reducing neuroinflammation or promoting neuronal survival. Our results indicate that 5xFAD mice benefit more from treatment with liposomes con- <!-- image --> www.advancedscience.com taining dual drugs (TR@CPLs) than single drugs (T@CPLs and R@CPL). This finding emphasizes the importance of a multitarget treatment protocol for AD. In addition, compatibility with appropriate carriers can improve the treatment e/uniFB03cacy of the drug. Compared to TR@PLs, which have a lower ability to target inflammation, TR@CPLs reduce the pathological protein burden much more and ameliorate neuroinflammation. Notably, both T@CPLs and TR@CPLs can decrease the expression of APP, which implies that the combination of TPPU and CPLs plays other roles in the pathological process of amyloid plaques. Currently, various carrier substances have been developed for the treatment of AD. Disease-modifying therapy for pathological protein burden has potential prospects. [ 52] Recently, the tautargeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) MAPTRx has been reported to decrease tau protein and p-tau protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. [ 53] However, it is administered through intrathecal injection, implying that such biomacromolecules often have di/uniFB03culty passing through the BBB. Diverse nanocarriers have been used to encapsulate peptides, [54] plasmids, [55] Cas9activating vectors, [ 56] miRNAs [57] or siRNAs [58] for AD intervention. Since cell membrane nanocarriers provide a similar intracellular environment for proteins and nucleotides, the binding of these encapsulated substances to CM-NPs may become a focus of future applications. In conclusion, we prepared drug-loaded hybrid cell-membrane liposomes to achieve precise targeting of inflammatory lesions in the brain and multidrug treatment. This original nanomedicine can improve the cognition of AD model mice, reduce amyloid plaque deposition, and alleviate neuroinflammation. Hybrid cell membrane-coated nanomaterials o/uniFB00er new opportunities for precise drug delivery and disease-specific targeting, which represent a versatile platform for targeted therapy in AD. With continued advancements in nanotechnology and cell biology, hybrid cell membrane-coated nanoparticles hold great promise as nextgeneration therapeutic modalities for various neurological disorders."

[3] In other words, microglia clears the A /u1D6FD via endocytosis to limit the amyloid-associated <!-- image --> www.advancedsciencenews.com pathological changes, [4] and meanwhile it activates the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome and thus induces a sustained innate immune response, which leads to the microglial death and release of A /u1D6FD accumulated in lysosomes into the extracellular space to promote the A /u1D6FD plaque growth. [5] Furthermore, the excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines into the neurological environment by activated microglia leads to mitochondria damage, which in turn exacerbates the inflammation to accelerate the neuronal injury. [ 6] Even worse, the activated microglia may engulf the stressed living neurons, i.e., the so-called microglial murder by phagocytosis. [ 7] Despite the extensive e/uniFB00orts to understand the involvement of microglia in AD, the e/uniFB00ective AD treatment based on microglia regulation is still an urgent need nowadays. [ 8] Calcium(Ca 2 + ) dyshomeostasis is critically involved in regulation of microglial function, [ 9] it initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress for cell apoptosis, a process depending on the Perk-eIF2 /u1D6FC signaling pathway. [10] Especially, under conditions of prolonged ER stress, UPR leads to a severe neurodegeneration, [10] meaning that the UPR - induced ER stress could serve as a potential therapeutic target. On the other hand, Perk activation also leads to the phosphorylation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which drives the anti-oxidant capacity and restricts the immunostimulatory response. [11] In consideration that Ca 2 + dyshomeostasis is reversible in the early stages of A /u1D6FD pathology, [ 10] one may reasonably deduce that a targeting therapy restoring the Ca 2 + homeostasis is likely a potent means for treating AD. Felodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) widely used in clinic for anti-hypertension treatment, has been found to improve the cognitive function in aged patients in a randomized and double-blind clinical trail through an additional blood pressure-independent e/uniFB00ect. [ 12a] However, oral administration of felodipine is very restricted and the bioavailability is very low because of its limited aqueous solubility and first-pass metabolism. [12b] Intravenous administration of felodipine is an alternative to oral administration and o/uniFB00ers greater bioavailability. However, intravenous injection of free felodipine may cause severe calcium channel blocker side e/uniFB00ects. [ 13] Besides, repeated injection of felodipine results in transient exposures of the mice to the drug frequently, which would increase the side-e/uniFB00ect risks including swollen or abscesses, ankle edema, headache, flushing, dizziness, and palpitations due to the vasodilatory action of the drug. [12c,13] Given the drawbacks of commercial product, it is of significance to develop a safer and more e/uniFB00ective medication forms for felodipine. So far, extensive studies have verified that encapsulation in liposome, a well-documented nanocarrier receiving intensive clinical applications, may greatly alleviate the adverse e/uniFB00ects of therapeutic agents. [ 14a] Furthermore, liposomes possess several characteristics such as high biocompatibility, low toxicity, ability to complex with negative and positive charged molecules, and large-scale manufacturing. [14b] In spite of the high encapsulating rate of liposome nanoparticles (LNP), the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle. [ 15a] Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) induces a cavitation effect of the micron-sized micro-bubbles (MB) after intravenous injection, which opens the BBB for 6 to 24 h to provide a window for delivering nanodrugs into brain tissue. [ 15b,c] Encouragingly, several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and feasibility <!-- image --> www.advancedscience.com of ultrasound-induced BBB opening (US - BBB). [16] For example, a study recently published by Rezai [ 17] et al. reported the use of low-intensity ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier in unilateral cortex or hippocampus within 24 to 48 h, which only caused few adverse events (mainly headache) and obviously facilitated the Aducanumab penetration into brain parenchyma for reducing A /u1D6FD levels in three AD patients. Herein, aiming at ameliorating the anxiety-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction in AD, we prepared a liposomal nanodrug incorporating felodipine (denoted as felodipine@LND) and then explored whether a transcranial LIPUS can reversibly open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to allow the felodipine@LND penetration for e/uniFB00ectively treating AD in 5xFAD mouse model ( Scheme 1 ). An e/uniFB03ciently delivered nanodrug may hopefully switch the UPR from a pro-apoptotic signaling toward an antioxidant signaling, decrease the A /u1D6FD seeding, and regulate the inflammatory microenvironment. If the nanodrug would work as expected, the treatment may likely promote the degradation of damaged neuronal mitochondria through unleashing mitophagy in noninflammatory conditions and improve the synaptic plasticity through reducing the loss of synapses.",
    "conclusion": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a major challenge for the delivery of e/uniFB00ective therapeutics to the brain. So far, there are sev- <!-- image --> www.advancedsciencenews.com eral promising strategies to overcome this obstacle and enhance the brain-targeting delivery of therapeutics. For example, preclinical data suggests the therapeutics can successfully penetrate BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis. However, the e/uniFB03ciency of delivery to the brain parenchyma is still limited, especially for nanoagents, [31a] which has impeded the translation of this strategy into clinical practice. Besides, engineered adeno - associated virus (AAVs) could cross BBB to deliver even large molecules to brain tissue. However, the risk of species-specific AAVs for clinical trials still remains unknown since these vehicles behaved differently in nonhuman primates and humans. [31b] On the other hand, the focused ultrasound (FUS), especially high-energy FUS (HIFU), may induce a strong cavitation e/uniFB00ect of microbubbles (MB) such as the clinically available SonoVue to tentatively open the BBB, which allows the delivery of therapeutic agents up to nanoscale to brain tissue of interest. However, this FUS - triggered e/uniFB00ect of MB may cause brain injuries including mild hemorrhage, edema, or even apoptosis. [ 31c] Herein, we employed the low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), which has been widely applied in clinic, to induce the cavitation e/uniFB00ect of microbubbles (MB) for BBB-crossing delivery of nanodrug to brain tissue in a safe manner. Our results verified that a skull exposure of LIPUS in combination with MBs temporarily opened the BBB in a reversible way without inducing apparent adverse e/uniFB00ects such as cell death or cerebral hemorrhage. Upon ultrasound irradiation, [32a] cavitation induced by microbubbles opens the tight junction of BBB endothelium temporarily. Within the time window of BBB opening, the nanodrug incorporating a Ca 2 + channel antagonist felodipine (felodipine@LND) penetrates the BBB and accumulates to the brain. Then, the nanodrug can be taken up by microglia rather than neurons or astrocyte. [ 32b,c] Once internalized into the microglia, liposome is digested with the help of lytic enzymes in lysosomal, upon which the phospholipid bilayers are broken and the encapsulated felodipine are released within the microglia in the AD brain. [32d] Microglia as brain-resident macrophages take up A /u1D6FD plaques and then transport them to lysosomes for degradation, but A /u1D6FD accumulation in lysosomes induces inflammatory responses to cause microglial death. Systematic histological and cell studies performed in our study verified that the nanodrug treatment with the aid of US plus SonoVue e/uniFB00ectively switched the Perk-eIF2 /u1D6FC arm to the Perk-Nrf2 arm in ER UPR, which inhibited the surface exposure of calreticulin and activation of NLRP3 to alleviate inflammatory responses in microglia as well as a protection against the mitochondria damage in neurons. So far, monoclonal antibodies nanomedicine targeting A /u1D6FD and tau are the most promising strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease, which however requires huge expenditure. Furthermore, most clinical trials on humanized anti-A /u1D6FD and anti-tau monoclonal antibodies have declared failure, [ 33a] which is usually accompanied by vasogenic oedema, cerebral amyloid angiopathy with microhemorrhages, and other adverse reactions. [33a] On the other hand, siRNAs capable of e/uniFB00ectively silencing gene expression in a sequence-specific manner have also demonstrated great therapeutic potential for AD. [ 33b] However, siRNA carriers have the risk of stimulating the immune response to cause some undesirable outcomes. [33b] Excitingly, the felodipine nanodrug e/uniFB00ectively mitigates the cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behavior in a 5xFAD mouse model, which revealed the potential of our <!-- image --> www.advancedscience.com new treatment regimen in treating Alzheimer's disease. The major attraction of BBB-crossing delivery of liposomal nanodrug incorporating felodipine to brain tissue using the LIPUS-BBB assistance lies in the possibility of rapid transition from pre-clinical models to patients, because the tolerability of the felodipine are known and the liposomal carrier has been used clinically."

Dementia has become a  major  public  health  challenge  and  imposes  enormous societal and economic burdens.

The two prominent pathological hallmarks of AD are the extracellular neuritic plaques (NPs) and intercellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of the accumulation  of  β-amyloid  (Aβ)  and  hyperphosphorylated  tau protein, respectively [4]. In addition, activation of inflammatory processes and immune responses are commonly observed in AD brain tissues [5]. As  an  age-related  neurodegenerative  disease,  AD  is divided into two subtypes according to the age of onset: early-onset  AD  (EOAD, &lt; 65  years)  and  late-onset  AD (LOAD, ≥ 65 years). Most AD cases are LOAD, a complex disease with heterogeneous etiologies including genetics, aging, environment, lifestyle, and chronic diseases, such as obesity [6]. EOAD accounts for about 10% of the total AD cases. Only 5% of patients with EOAD carry a pathogenic variant in the AD genes ( APP , PSEN1 ,  and PSEN2 coding for the amyloid precursor protein, the presenilin 1  and  2,  respectively)  or  the  apolipoprotein  E  ( APOE ) ε4  allele.  The  pathogenesis  remains  unknown  in  most patients with EOAD [7]. Although  the  symptoms  of  AD  are  well-studied,  no treatments can halt and reverse the progression of AD. Our understanding of AD pathogenesis is still limited. At present, the pathogenic hypotheses of AD mainly include the amyloid cascade hypothesis, tau hypothesis, inflammatory hypothesis, cholinergic hypothesis, etc. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is the most widely accepted one. However,  nearly,  all  anti-Aβ  drugs  have  failed  to  show satisfactory therapeutic efficacy in the past two decades. It is encouraging that in 2021, aducanumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody targeting Aβ, became the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) drug for AD approved by an accelerated pathway of the US Food and Drug  Administration  (FDA).  This  approval  based  on reduced amyloid markers and its clinical efficacy remains controversial [8, 9]. In January 2023, FDA approved a new monoclonal antibody against Aβ called lecanemab for the treatment  of  early  AD,  also  by  its  accelerated  approval pathway. Lecanemab  reduced  brain amyloid burden markedly in early AD and cognitive decline moderately than  placebo  at  18  months  but  was  related  to  adverse events [10]. The efficacy or long-term safety of these two drugs needs further validation. In addition, it is timely to revisit the amyloid cascade hypothesis and consider other targets, such as anti-tau or anti-inflammatory drug development  for  AD.  Increasing  evidence  demonstrates  that the cognitive dysfunction and severity of the disease are more related to tau pathology [11-14]. The inflammatory responses (especially neuroinflammation) accompany the entire progress of AD pathogenesis and are also linked to cognitive dysfunction [15]. Therefore, this review focuses on tau pathological changes in the progression of AD and summarizes recent studies on the mutual regulation and influence  of  neuroinflammation  and  tau  pathology.  The current clinical drug development based on the tau and inflammation  hypotheses  is  also  discussed.  This  review will provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and drug treatment strategies.",
    "conclusion": "Over the past few decades, accumulated efforts in basic and clinical research in the AD field have improved our understanding of the multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis.  It  is  particularly  encouraging  that  two  DMT drugs  targeting  Aβ  have  recently  received  accelerated FDA approval for AD treatment. However, the efficacy of these drugs is controversial and needs further validation. The most likely reason for the failure of drugs targeting Aβ may be that Aβ pathology in AD does not always correlate with cognitive decline. Tau  has  received  increasing  attention  as  a  potential alternative  therapeutic  target,  since  evidence  indicates that  tau  pathology  is  more  associated  with  cognitive degradation.  To  date,  there  are  no  tau-focused  drugs approved  by  FDA.  Still,  several  agents  targeting  tau post-translational  modification  and  dissemination  have recently entered clinical trials for treating AD and other tauopathies.  Accumulating  evidence  indicates  that  neuroinflammation may be the third pathological feature of AD and  plays  an  integral  role  in  AD  pathogenesis  and the promotion of cognitive impairment. In recent years, growing  findings  of  fundamental  research  have  demonstrated  the  complex  interplay  between  neuroinflammation and tau pathology, as summarized above. These findings suggest that in the early stage of AD, a moderate  inflammatory  response  may  alleviate  tau  pathology, such  as  activated  microglia  promoting  the  clearance  of tau  seeds.  While  in  the  middle  and  late  stages  of  AD, sustained and increased inflammatory responses in glial cells and neurons are pivotal cellular drivers and regulators  of  the  exacerbation  of  tau  pathology,  further  contributing  to  its  worsening  by  promoting  inflammatory responses.  This  vicious  circle  aggravates  the  pathological  progression  of  AD.  There  are  temporal  and  spatial dynamic regulatory processes between tau pathology and inflammation as the disease progresses. Further elucidation  of  these  dynamic  regulatory  mechanisms  will  provide  essential  insights  into  AD  pathogenesis  and  drug development. Furthermore,  current  studies  indicate  that  targeting only a single therapeutic target may not be able to reverse the  pathological  process  of  AD.  As  mentioned  above, multi-target therapies (including multi-target single drugs such as the p38α inhibitors and single or multiple target  multi-drug combination such as the combination of  dasatinib  and  quercetin)  targeting  tau  pathology  and neuroinflammation, or simultaneously targeting Aβ pathology,  which  is  currently  undergoing  clinical  trials, may offer hope of reversing the course of AD and even curing it. These therapeutic strategies have shown good safety and tolerability, and clinical trials of their therapeutic effects are underway. In summary, both basic research and clinical trials suggest that targeting multiple pathologies and precise treatment strategies will be the trend of future drug development for AD and other tauopathies. They  will  be  more  likely  to  bring  breakthroughs  in  the treatment of these diseases."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease (ND) and the characteristics of AD include cognitive deficit and memory loss that can eventually disrupt the motor system, visuospatial orientation, speech, and behavior [1,2]. Several neuropathological hallmarks of AD including inflammation, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and extracellular A β deposits have already been well identified [3-5]. Tau proteins and deposits of A β peptides are detected in different brain areas, which can further lead to microglial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction, and even neuronal cell death [6,7]. Characteristics of AD-related inflammation include reactive microglia around A β plaques, which preserve an inflammatory state via releasing various proinflammatory mediators, which can ultimately lead to neuronal loss. In the case of AD, reactive gliosis histology indicates the aberrant morphology and proliferation of microglia and astrocytes. It has been reported that astrogliosis and microgliosis are common characteristics of numerous NDs with different causes [8-10], however it was not certain whether these histopathological alterations reflect an inconsequential, harmful, or beneficial function of glial cells in the neurodegenerative process. Unfortunately, currently available drugs can only provide symptomatic treatment of AD (Table 1), instead of curing or preventing this devastating disease. Microglia play role as the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) [11,12]. Self-renewal and homeostasis of microglia is maintained via various factors, such as macrophage-colony stimulating factor and transforming growth factor signaling [13-15]. Microglia play crucial roles in CNS tissue maintenance, pathogen defense, and injury response [16,17]. In addition, they play roles in the developmental sculpting of neural circuits via engulfing and removing unwanted synapses and neurons [18,19]. Microglia have multifaceted roles in the course of AD because of their various phenotypes and a range of activation pathways. After pathological stimulation, extremely branched microglia have the capacity to alter to an amoeboid form [20,21]. In aging brains, microglia have reduced level of branching that decreases their capacity of surveillance, which can further lead to impaired homeostatic functions [22-24]. In diseased brains, morphology of microglia differs owing to the spatial location and AD stage. Amyloid plaque-linked microglia also go through dramatic and morphological alterations, while plaque-distant microglia exhibit minor alterations over time [25]. As compared to the brains at earlier ADstages, microglia in Braak stage V-VI brains possess more intense morphological alterations [26]. The progressive variety in microglial structure may take place because of the duration and intensity of the pathological environment [27], however this may also take place because of the differences in responses of microglia to different stimuli including tau or A β aggregation [28]. It has been reported that dystrophic microglia emergence precedes tau pathology development [29,30]. Soluble form of hyperphosphorylated tau may trigger the phenotypic alteration in microglia, which can further cause loss of immunosurveillance activity and mediate AD progression via the formation of NFTs [26]. Collectively, these findings suggest that phenotypic alterations in microglia including behavior, proteomic signatures, and morphology are linked with AD progression [31,32]. It has been revealed that M1 microglia secrete various inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, which can result in neuronal death and inflammation (Figure 1) [33], whereas tissue repair and maintenance are linked with alternative M2 microglial activation [34]. In addition, M2 microglia mediate neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas M1 microglia mediate neurotoxicity and inflammation. Indeed, both of these phenotypes play roles in the NDs, thus microglia have the capacity to play role as a double-edged sword in NDs [35]. Therefore, precise regulation of microglia activation is important for the normal activity of microglia to prevent NDs and maintain brain homoeostasis [36]. Figure 1. Schematic description of M1 and M2 polarization of microglia and their immunoregulatory functions. <!-- image --> In AD mice, parabiosis studies showed that microglia are responsible for the elevated level of myeloid cells found in brains containing plaque pathology, along with the negligible impact of infiltrating macrophages [37]. In this review, we have highlighted the molecular pathogenesis of AD, microglial functions in the adult brain, the effect of microglia in the aging brain, and the effect of microglia in AD. Furthermore, we have focused on the importance of targeting microglia for AD treatment. Information for the review was gathered from a variety of sources and databases, including Science Direct, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus. Several keywords were utilized in this study, including Microglia, Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta, brain, A β plaques, tau protein, neuroinflammation, therapeutics, CSF1R, immunoreceptors, etc. The data were gathered from manuscripts, theses, books, book chapters, conference proceedings, and other publications published till 2022.

    "conclusion": "Currently available therapies for AD provide symptomatic treatment only, instead of targeting the underlying mechanisms associated with AD. Therefore, there is a strong need for treatment options that can interact with the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and slow down its advancement. Neuroinflammation is one such downstream target, which is a cause instead of a consequence of neurodegeneration. Mechanisms that are linked with AD pathogenesis are highly complex and microglia are the key neuroinflammation modulators. In addition, microglia have a significant contribution in triggering synaptic dysfunction and loss; however, the precise and exact mechanisms are yet to be fully revealed. Thus, better knowledge regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the microglia-synapse interaction is required on an urgent basis for the development of novel anti-AD therapies. Moreover, more studies are required regarding whether or not the prevention of microgliamediated removal of synapses decreases cognitive deficits and averts neurodegeneration.

    "introduction": "Due to advances in healthcare and increased longevity, societies of all industrialized and non-industrialized countries are seeing a significant increase in the prevalence of common neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These devastating disorders represent the biggest challenge and an immense economic burden for all health systems around the world. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive neuronal loss that leads to a decline in memory and other cognitive functions, i.e., dementia, culminating in the loss of independence in activities of daily living. To illustrate the potential magnitude of AD's impact, epidemiologists have estimated that the global prevalence of AD in people older than 65 years will rise to 150 million by 2050 [1]. This alarming estimation shows the urgency to develop novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of this gigantic public health challenge. Histologically, AD is defined by two core neuropathological hallmarks: the accumulation of extracellular amyloid β (A β ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein [2]. However, classical neuropathological features begin even decades before the first cognitive symptoms manifest [3]. Additionally, the pre-pathological stages of AD are thought to be characterized by latent neuroinflammation [4], alterations in the blood-brain barrier [5], accelerated cellular senescence [6], and dysfunction of the glymphatic system [7]. This cellular phase occurs alongside the processing and accumulation of A β aggregates. According to the current but debated hypothesis, A β triggers tau pathology. The neuroanatomical spread of misfolded tau species correlates tightly with the clinical progression of the disease [8]. <!-- image --> Citation: Serradas, M.L.; Ding, Y.; Martorell, P.V.; Kuli´ nska, I.; Castro-Gomez, S.

    "conclusion": "Neuroinflammation is not only a mere contributor but can also be a driving force behind AD pathophysiology and progression. Several studies testing antibodies, inhibitors, agonists, and diets targeting neuroinflammation have brought hope for improved therapy in AD (Table 1). However, the complexity of immune interactions poses an important obstacle to address in drug research. Acute neuroinflammation is necessary for maintaining brain homeostasis while the sustained overactivation of the innate immune system can be a priming factor for disease development and exacerbate its progression. A great example of this are microglia, which are crucial in brain development, in maintaining homeostasis, and in the response to DAMPs/PAMPs, including the clearance of A β . However, their chronic activation leads to impaired A β removal, synapse engulfment, and neuronal damage, resulting in neurodegeneration. Thus, it is necessary to find the right balance of specific immune system components to avoid detrimental side effects. Moreover, it is important to consider the best time window and the administration routes as well as interactions with genetic and environmental factors to increase the probability of success in clinical studies. However, the intricacy of the immune system has also advantages as it presents multiple promising targets for therapeutic modification: from specific immune cell modulators, through pro-inflammatory cytokines to multiprotein complexes. Therefore, the further understanding of the innate immune system within the context of neurodegeneration should be the main focus as it provides new directions for medical intervention in AD.

    "introduction": "The greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is advanced age, and the aging (&gt;65 years) population is currently the largest in history [1, 2]. Thus, ADRD represents one of the greatest public health crises worldwide [1, * Corresponding Authors: Ruth Barrientos: Ruth.Barrientos@osumc.edu Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, 460 Medical Center Dr., room 319, Columbus, OH 43210, USA; Anne-Marie Duchemin: AnneMarie.Duchemin@osumc.edu. - 3]. Indeed, an estimated 44 million people are currently affected globally, and many more are estimated to develop ADRD in the years to come [1, 3]. AD is characterized by a progressive cognitive impairment beginning as a mild memory loss that gradually, and sometimes precipitously, culminates into deep dementia [4-7]. Indeed, the preclinical and prodromal phases of the disease are thought to last approximately 20 years followed by a clinical duration of approximately 8-10 years [5]. Neuropathologically, the most prominently affected brain structure in AD is the hippocampus and its surrounding entorhinal cortex [8]. Given its many afferent, efferent, and intrahippocampal connections along the hippocampal septotemporal axis facilitating its physiological activity [9-11], the hippocampal complex is widely considered as the center of brain networks implicated in novelty detection, regulation of emotion, fear, stress, and learning and memory [12-14]. and long-term episodic memory deficits, spatial memory, navigational impairments, Thus, it is not surprising that the most common cognitive disruptions in ADRD include short difficulty sustaining attention, mood swings, and loss of motivation [15, 16]. Neuroanatomical and behavioral studies have demonstrated that the hippocampus is involved in multiple learning and memory processes [17, 18], and physiological and neurochemical disciplines have determined the essential role of synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling systems, respectively [19, 20]. In this review we discuss how alterations in neuronal structures associated with functional connectivity are a main cause of hippocampaldependent cognitive decline and introduce a family of proteins, CRMPs (collapsin response mediator proteins) that may play important roles for early detection and treatment of AD.",
    "conclusion": "Dystrophic axons and dendrites and dysfunctional synapses are at the heart of the neurodegeneration-causing memory deficits in AD. Therefore, novel molecules, such as CRMPs, known to play key roles in the formation, reshaping, or reparation of synaptic structures, and in important immune cell functions have the potential to make an impact in the early detection and treatment of AD."

    "introduction": "Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) represent a major current health challenge due to the aging and the lifestyle of the population, the number of people affected, the impact of these diseases on the life of the patients and their caretakers, and the financial impact that these entails [1,2]. Worldwide, more than 50 million people are affected by neurodegenerative diseases, and this number will almost triple to 152 million in 2050 if no effective preventive or therapeutic solutions are found. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most frequent type of neurodegenerative disease, occurring in 60% to 80% of all cases [3]. AD, discovered in 1907, has multiple etiologies, but the exact causes of the disease have not yet been clearly established. In addition, no curative treatment has been developed, even more than a century later. There are two forms of AD: (1) the genetic form or the autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD), which occurs before the age of 65, representing less than 1% of cases; (2) the sporadic form. Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (SAD) usually occurs <!-- image --> <!-- image --> after age 65, and the risk of the disease's occurrence doubles every five years [4]. Here, our review focuses on sporadic AD. AD pathology results from both structural and functional damage in the central nervous system (CNS), including abnormal aggregation of proteins in the nervous system and neurodegenerative processes. Indeed, two types of lesions have been identified in AD, including amyloid plaques composed of beta-amyloid peptides (A β ), which accumulate abnormally outside the nerve cells [5], and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) due to the hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which accumulates in neurons [6]. AD can be considered a progressive process of biochemical, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and cognitive disorders [7]. The initial oligomerization of soluble A β in the brain causes localized dysfunctions of dendrites, axonal processes, and synapses. During the past decade, research efforts have focused on soluble A β oligomers (A β O), which appear to be a more toxic and disease-relevant form of A β [8,9]. A β Oare considered to be pathological agents that appear before the first neuropathological signs of AD [10,11]. Then, brain lesions gradually form, associated with neuronal loss in certain regions of the brain, but without clinical expression [12-15]. With time, AD is manifested by loss of memory and cognitive abilities [16]. Many therapeutic strategies have been explored for several decades in clinical trials, but the treatments currently available are primarily treatments of symptoms [17-19] rather than actual curative therapies. Because of this, attention has turned towards prevention or reducing AD risk. Research has shown that in the world, more than 30% of AD cases could be due to modifiable risk factors, which could provide interesting and promising targets for prevention strategies to reduce the risk of AD-related cognitive decline and perhaps NDin general [3,20,21]. Current challenges focus on improving the early detection of the disease at the preclinical stage [22]. Various studies have shown the critical role of lipid nutrients in the brain and cognitive functions. The brain has significant levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), incorporated into phospholipids, amphiphilic molecules that are components of neuronal membranes [23,24]. Several studies have demonstrated their potential neuroprotective role in neuron function and synapse plasticity [25]. Since diet is an important source of these PUFA, nutritionally-based prevention strategies can be used towards optimizing CNS lipid status [26]. Another challenge in AD treatments is the efficient delivery and targeting of molecules of interest to the brain due to the protective barriers of the central nervous system [27,28]. With the brain as the target tissue, one obstacle that needs to be overcome is the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). BBB protects the CNS from potential neurotoxins, toxic organisms, and chemical substances in the blood, but that also limits its accessibility for many therapeutic drug molecules [27]. The use of nanoparticles (NP), with sizes between 10 and 1000 nm, capable of encapsulating therapeutic molecules by targeting transport processes in the CNS, can improve the crossing of molecules through the BBB in neurological disorders and reach targeted brain regions [29-31]. Soft NP, such as nanoliposomes (NL) or exosomes, represent one of the most effective drug delivery processes to be able to protect therapeutic agents and deliver them to the target tissues [32,33]. A growing number of studies report a restorative effect of NL on cellular and animal models of neurological disorders (stroke, Parkinson's disease, AD) [34-36], suggesting improved NP-mediated bioavailability in the CNS. Furthermore, nanotechnology can be used to improve the bioavailability of PUFA in the form of NL [34,37]. NLs are spherical and closed vesicles with diameters in the nanometer range, formed by phospholipid bilayers dispersed in an aqueous medium [38,39]. NL can be designed to contain n-3 PUFA-rich phospholipids with beneficial neuroprotective properties. Moreover, NL can be used to encapsulate a variety of molecules, including hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs, proteins, or DNA [40]. They represent an excellent drug delivery process because of their biofilm characteristics which closely resemble those of cell membranes. In addition, NL forms a protective barrier that protects the molecules from degradation by enzymes in the mouth and stomach, digestive juices, bile acid, and intestinal microorganisms [41,42]. In this work, we review the clinical and physiopathology of SAD, including research models of AD, followed by a discussion of current treatments focusing on prevention strategies and the use of soft NP such as NL and exosome as innovative approaches for a preventive strategy in reducing the risk of AD.",
    "conclusion": "ADis a progressive cortical neurodegenerative disease leading to the insidious onset of multiple cognitive disorders and gradual evolution over time. Existing therapeutic strategies are aimed towards slowing the progression of AD but are not curative approaches. Strategies of prevention play an important role in the primary prevention of cognitive symptoms and are called for in this disease, where initial lesions form at an early preclinical stage and progress insidiously for years. Drug delivery to the CNS is a very complex process and challenging to ensure that the brain absorbs the full benefit of the drugs. In this review, new strategies to improve access to the therapeutic drug to the CNS have been analyzed and discussed, including liposomes and exosomes, shown to be effective drug delivery systems for the brain. Choosing the best pathway of medications and liposomes and exosomes to the brain is a very important topic in order to have the best efficiency as well as the better targeting zone in the brain. Among the different methods used in the literature, the IN method shows a better absorption efficiency because of the speed of the flow of drugs or NP to the brain. IN administration of liposomes is promising for the treatment of AD by virtue of its potential to facilitate molecule penetration across the BBB, better bioavailability, and efficacy by protecting the drug from peripheral degradation. Other applications that also need to be considered include the use of gene editing for ADtreatment [267,268], as well as antibody therapy targeting A β and tau proteins [269]. These topics have been discussed in other reviews as cited. Amyloid and aggregate clearance systems in non-human organisms such as yeast may also bring new insight into potential anti-Alzheimer therapeutics [270-272]. The combined use of strategies to reduce the amyloid burden and tau-protein aggregation with efficient delivery to brain tissues could be of potential benefit to AD patients.

    "introduction": "Multiple factors are involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease which makes it difficult to find the complete cure for the disease. Biomarkers related pathologies have also been observed (Sweeney et al. 2019). The major attributes of Alzheimer's disease are senile plaques or Aβ plaques generated by the abnormal cleavage of Amyloid Precursor * Dibbanti HariKrishna Reddy harikrishnareddy0011@gmail.com; harikrishna.reddy@cup.edu.in 1 Department of Pharmacology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda 151 401, India 2 Department of Pharmacology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, India 3 Department of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College &amp; Hospital, Chandigarh 160 032, India Protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles produced by hyperphosphorylation of tau. Brain regions mostly affected by the disease are hippocampus, neocortex and amygdala. Alzheimer's disease leads to dementia which accounts for over 131.5 million people worldwide (Sengoku 2020). Out of all dementia cases across the globe AD accounts for 90% of the whole. Behavioral and psychological symptoms are common in AD (Kales et al. 2019). It is believed that Alzheimer's disease symptoms arise after 20 years of acquiring the disease. The nerve cells involved in thinking, memory and learning get damaged due to which symptoms like memory loss and language difficulties arise. This makes the patient unable to perform his routine works. Gradually the person becomes bedridden and ultimately leads to death of the Alzheimer's Association (2019). Vascular diseases, age, head trauma, family history, low physical activity, environmental factors and smoking are major risk elements of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are helpful in the diagnosis of the <!-- image --> <!-- image --> disease. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), brain biopsy and Retinal Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are other diagnostic methods among which brain biopsy is considered to be the most definitive one (Atri 2019). Out of the multiple factors responsible for the disease neuroinflammation has a vital role (Fig. 1). Studies suggest the involvement of over-activation of microglial cells and astrocytes along with inflammatory molecules in the pathogenesis of the disease (Uddin et al. 2020). Neuroinflammation acts as double edged sword for the brain, as it clears deposited Aβ and produces cytotoxic substances which aggravate the deposition of Aβ and cause neurodegeneration. Many experiments proved high accumulation of inflammatory mediators around NFTs and amyloid plaques which makes the involvement of neuroinflammation in AD quite evident (Ahmad et al. 2019). Major inflammatory cells in the CNS are microglia and astrocytes. Microglia are macrophages which cover 10% of the total population of cells in the CNS. It is involved in the neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis and acts as first line of defense in any injury of the brain. Major Cytokines found in AD brains are Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). The activity of β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is increased by these cytokines resulting in increased generation of Aβ (Calsolaro and Edison 2016). Aging has profound effect in the pathogenesis of AD, it also affects innate immunity of the body. Inflammasomes are the structures responsible for the release <!-- image --> Fig. 1 Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Figure 1 depicts the multiple  factors  responsible  for  the  progression  of  Alzheimer's  disease.  Amyloid  plaques  and  hyperphosphorylated  tau  are  the  major ones.  Extracellular  amyloid  β  deposition  leads  to  the  generation  of senile plaques. Hyperphosphorylated tau leads to the disassembly of microtubules  and  damages  the  cytoskeleton  and  signal  transduction processes  in  neuronal  cells.  Other  factors  like  neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, cholinergic insufficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction and  autophagy  dysfunction  also  play  major  role  in  the  disease  progression <!-- image --> of interleukins but during aging there is marked reduction of inflammasomes leading to reduction in cytokines (Cao and Zheng 2018). Due to the degeneration of neurons there is infiltration of inflammatory mediators, activation of innate immune system and glial cells at the accumulation site. It is believed that this occurs at initial stages of the disease and contributes in the progression of the disease (Deardorff and Grossberg 2017). Mild activation of microglia is beneficial as it clears the cell debris, damaged neurons and promotes survival of cells in the brain. But if there is chronic inflammation of neurons the microglia and other inflammatory cells get hyperactivated which can be toxic to the neuronal cells (Domingues et al. 2017). When microglia becomes hyperactive, a protein known as Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is also highly expressed which serves as a biomarker and helps in imaging of inflammation in the brain and TSPO levels are monitored by employing PET techniques (Knezevic and Mizrahi 2018). Reduction in the infiltration of inflammatory molecules and removal of damaged mitochondria is stimulated by an innate system of the body known as mitophagy (Lautrup et al. 2019).",
    "conclusion": "AD is a rapidly progressing disorder contributing to neurodegeneration. Many hypotheses have been made regarding the pathophysiology of the disease including mainly tau hypothesis and amyloid β hypothesis. But due to the involvement of several factors in the pathogenesis of the disease complete cure is still on the urge of development. Many evidences support the involvement of brain inflammation in the development of the disease. The major cells involved in the neuroinflammation process in the brain are glial cells including microglia and astrocytes. Other cells involved in neuroinflammation are oligodendrocytes, pericytes and neurons. In AD brains these cells become hyperactive and potentiate the release of inflammatory mediators like cytokines, chemokines, interferons and interleukins which get accumulated around senile plaques in the brain and contribute to neuroinflammation. Various inflammatory molecules are involved in the progression of AD. Interleukins promotes the activation of T-lymphocytes mediated toxicity, increase the activity of macrophages and neutrophils. Inflammatory cytokines are released from glial cells and are of two types, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Chemokines may powerfully direct microglial relocation and enlistment of astrocytes to the site of neuroinflammation, preferring the degree of local aggravation of inflammation. Other inflammatory molecules are neutrophils and interferons. Pathways like NFκB, MAPK, Akt/mTOR, p38, COX and nitric oxide pathways are involved in the release of inflammatory molecules from microglia by activating it or potentiating M1 state of microglia. AMPK pathway generally ameliorates the inflammatory response by inhibiting mTOR pathway. Anti-inflammatory molecules like minocycline are employed for reducing Aβ and tau pathologies by mitigating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from glial cells. Inhibition of iNOS and Cox-2 is also considered effective in ameliorating neuroinflammation in AD patients. Other anti-inflammatory molecules are curcumin, catechin, Vitamin E and Vitamin C. Celecoxib a cox-2 selective inhibitor, also ameliorates inflammation in brain. Pioglitazone a PPARγ agonist, changes the M1 state of microglia to M2 state which increases the phagocytosis of deposited Aβ. PPARγ agonists also reduce the synthesis of IL-1β inflammatory cytokines. Many drugs targeting neuroinflammation inducing pathways are under different phases of clinical trials. As there is a need of development of complete cure for Alzheimer's disease, focusing neuroinflammation pathways can come out as effective treatment for the disease.

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by declining cognition and memory. The defects in cholinergic neurons indicate the primary feature representing AD. These include the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the basal nucleus  of  Meynert, 1 the  decline  of  choline  acetyltransferase  activity, 2 and the reduction of cholinergic basal cortical projection. 3 The two typical pathologies of AD involve the formation of senile plaques  by  amyloid β peptide  (A β )  deposition  and  neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) by hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein. 4 This could lead to the subsequent death of neurons. However, the underlying mechanism behind neurodegeneration, neurotoxicity, and cognitive impairment remains unclear. According to these findings, cholinesterase inhibitors were first developed  to  treat  AD. 5 Three  cholinesterase  inhibitors  are  currently approved for AD: donepezil, galanthamine, and rivastigmine. Additionally, memantine, which can regulate glutamate, dopamine, serotonin,  acetylcholine,  and  other  excitatory  neurotransmission, was  extensively  used  in  AD  patients.  In  June  2021,  a  novel  drug called  aducanumab  (trade  name  'Aduhelm')  was  approved  by  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. This was followed by the approval of lecanemab (trade name 'Leqembi') in January  2023.  Aducanumab  and  lecanemab  are  immunoglobulin gamma 1 monoclonal antibodies selectively binding to A β fibrils and soluble oligomers. 6,7 These drugs provide a new treatment strategy, representing a breakthrough in AD treatment. The  above  six  drugs  are  the  only  approved  therapeutic  drugs against  AD.  Other  than  the  controversial  aducanumab  and  justapproved lecanemab, the therapeutic results of the other drugs also remained unsatisfactory. Since these drugs could not prevent neuronal degeneration, although they improved the clinical symptoms and quality of life of patients during the initial treatment stages. The biggest challenge is the short-  term efficacy of these drugs, which is  approximately  1 ~ 3 years,  and  cannot  prevent  the  disease  from progressing. 1 The dismal condition of AD therapy requires attention. Early detection and intervention could be possible solutions. Early diagnosis facilitates the identification of reversible causes, improves symptom management, and provides a future plan. In addition, based on the cost-  effectiveness  analysis,  the  cost  of  early  interventions  is  less than subsequent dementia treatment. 8 Biomarkers  have  excellent prospects for early diagnosis. They are a class of molecules occurring in biological media, such as fluids or cells, and depict physiological states, pathological processes, or therapeutic agent responses. The significance of the biomarkers lies in: (1) Finding the latent disease to provide an opportunity for early intervention, particularly in patients having neurological disorders. (2) Providing some clues to molecular pathological mechanisms of AD, depending on the correlation between the appearance timing and changes in molecular biomarker levels and disease process. (3) Assisting in the differential diagnosis and determining the causes of the disease to select more targeted treatments, facilitating individualized treatment, and managing AD <!-- image --> patients. 9 (4) Developing new drugs based on the mechanisms and targets.  AD  drugs  in  the  market  and  under  investigation  are  presented in Figure 1 (developed using BioRe  nder.com). Some biomarkers have already been identified and utilized in AD diagnosis, and more candidate biomarkers being investigated.",
    "conclusion": "Biomarkers exploration is essential in detecting diseases because it can help predict, diagnose, identify, treat diseases, and understand disease processes. In 2021, A β 42 , t-   Tau, p-  Tau, and NFL were incorporated into the diagnostic criteria of AD, marking a significant breakthrough  in  studying  biomarkers  for  neurological  disorders.  Other biomarkers,  including  inflammation-  related  and  synaptic  functionrelated biomarkers, are promising for future clinical implications due to their confirmed pathologies in AD. However, since the pathological  phenomenon  behind  microvascular  damage  is  not  fully  established in AD and could only be a secondary lesion in the late stage, its significance as a biomarker for early diagnosis may be minimal. 96 Similar changes occur in many neurological diseases, and the specificity is not high in AD, even though lipid metabolites may be a new direction. 135 Thus, the possibility of utilizing them as early diagnostic markers for AD is doubtful. MiRNA has been a hot area recently since its length is too short and its nucleotide sequences are not specific. 107 However, the accuracy of precise identification of one particular RNA needs to be enhanced, and the combined detection results of multiple molecules would probably be more reliable. Nevertheless, the application prospect of such biomarkers is also worrying. The common issues with many of them require an urgent solution. First, some studies on the same potential biomarkers indicated divergent  or  opposite  results  (Table  2).  Therefore,  more  in-  depth studies are needed to determine the reliability of novel biomarkers. Second,  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  many  candidate  biomarkers have not been satisfactory enough. To address this issue, scientists  have  actively  experimented  strategies  that  use  multiple potential  biomarkers,  evaluating  the  relationship  between  various biomarkers and diseases and gauging whether diagnostic accuracy can be improved using multiple biomarkers. Some results have been achieved. For instance, the ratio of A β 42 /A β 40 has superior performance than A β 42 alone. 115 The increase in the neurogranin/BACE1 ratio predicts cognitive decline. 70,152 The concentrations of YKL-  40 and sTREM inflammatory biomarkers are closely associated with the changes in brain imaging. Thus, combining inflammatory biomarkers with imaging can improve the diagnostic yield among subjects. 93 A good combination of biomarkers can enhance the specificity and <!-- image --> sensitivity of diseases, thereby compensating for the shortcomings of a single biomarker in practical application. The third problem is sampling. CSF and blood mainly represent current samples for biomarkers. CSF sampling is more complex, expensive, and invasive than blood, making it unsuitable for repeat operations in a short time. In contrast, blood sampling avoids the above problems  with  higher  clinical  feasibility.  Inevitably,  blood  samples can be contaminated with trace amounts of protein or lipids. Hence, these impurities should be accommodated when setting the range for  abnormal  values.  Nevertheless,  exploring  blood  biomarkers  in neurological diseases should be the focus of future research. 153 In addition, the discovery of biomarkers also provides direction and ideas for developing new drugs. Targeted agents based on A β , BACE1, and Tau are in clinical trials, and aducanumab and lecanemab are already available in the market. These compounds have significant potential to become new drugs for AD treatment. Although there is little convincing evidence that current biomarkers are sufficiently specific and sensitive to diagnose AD, the potential socioeconomic and medical benefits of developing drugs to treat AD still make the search for biomarkers a fruitful area of study."

    "introduction": "The central nervous system (CNS), as an 'immuno-privileged' organ, hosts numerous populations of myeloid cells and defensive barriers such as the meninges, the perivascular space, and the choroid plexus [1]. Under steady-state conditions, the central myeloid cell populations in the CNS are represented by parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal macrophages, namely perivascular macrophages, meningeal macrophages, macrophages of the choroid plexus, and blood-borne monocytes [2,3] (Figure 1). All of these populations are characterized by specific localization and molecular profiles [2,3]. Microglia are a unique tissue-resident macrophage population of the CNS and are considered to be primarily involved in immune reactions and inflammatory diseases [4]. <!-- image --> Int. J. Mol.

    "conclusion": "Many neurodegenerative and autoimmune CNS disorders are still orphan diseases, and in the long term the current therapeutic approaches are highly ineffective. It is now believed that targeting the CNS myeloid populations may represent a promising strategy, aimed at modulating cellular activation and switching the cellular phenotype from neurotoxic to neuroprotective. Indeed, anti-inflammatory approaches have failed to be effective, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases, both in animal models and in clinical trials. Many potential microglial targets have been identified, and several molecules are currently being tested in preclinical models. However, despite the encouraging results, much more effort is needed to progress these molecules into the clinical setting. Also, it is of primary relevance to continue expanding basic knowledge on microglia/CNS macrophages biology in order to identify key genes and signaling pathways that regulate CNS homeostasis and potentially control the pathophysiology of CNS diseases.

    "introduction": "Worldwide increase in life expectancy has produced a dramatic rise in the prevalence, and thus impact of aging-associated diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the biomedicine and society at large. It has been estimated that 5.8 million Americans live with AD in 2020, and that number is projected to triplicate by mid-century. Currently, it is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in patients 65 years of age and older (Alzheimer's Association, 2020) Clinically AD is characterized by slowly progressive neurodegeneration leading to overt cognitive decline involving loss of memory and higher executive functioning. The core pathological hallmarks of AD in the brain are accumulated extracellular plaques composed of amyloidβ (A β ) proteins, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau (Fig. 1), both contributing to the damage and death of neurons (Ittner and Gotz, 2011). Recent research demonstrated that sustained neuroinflammation, impairments of mitochondrial bioenergetics and protein homeostasis have also prominent role in unfolding of AD (Kinney et al., 2018; Perez Ortiz and Swerdlow, 2019; Veitch et al., 2019), thus implying to multifactorial etiology of the disease. AD exists under two forms: sporadic AD (sAD), characterized by late onset and accounts for vast majority of AD cases, and familial AD (fAD), an early onset and dominantly inherited disease, which accounts for less than 1% of cases (Alzheimer's Association, 2020). For sAD, age is the major risk factor, <!-- image --> but carrying the ApoEε 4 genetic polymorphism highly increase the likelihood of developing disease in subjects older than 65 years. The fAD has more rapid progression affecting younger subjects with highly penetrant mutations in the genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein (APP), and presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) that result in accumulation of A β and formation of plaques (Bertram and Tanzi, 2012). Despite significant advances in our understanding of pathological mechanisms involved in AD, treatment options are still limited. Existing drugs provide only short-term symptomatic benefits, while the development of effective disease-modifying therapeutic interventions that would prevent, halt, or reverse AD seems to be notoriously difficult task given the large number of compounds, particularly those targeting A β , which failed in late-stage clinical trials (Cummings et al., 2020; Long and Holtzman, 2019). Repeated setbacks in development of AD treatments recently prompted changes in the research strategy, which increasingly begins to focus on multifaceted targets and their possible interactions rather than just on disease canonical mainstays, A β and hyperphosphorylated tau. At this inflection point, it is necessary to critically evaluate all potential factors that influence negative outcomes in clinical trials, from translatability of results obtained in preclinical AD models to predictive validity of currently used biomarkers for treatment efficacy and improvement in the disease state. In this review we provide an updated outline of the current therapeutic possibilities, status of AD drug development focusing mainly on compounds being tested in clinical trials, and an overview of emerging non-pharmacological treatment interventions. We also discuss challenges and limitations in AD discovery efforts, and importance of inclusion of functional biomarkers such as neurophysiological signatures of disease, which combining with currently used fluid and imaging biomarkers would form multicomponent biomarker panel for ensuring adequate translation of preclinical to human studies and leveraging treatment development research into patients benefit.",
    "conclusion": "There must be multiple reasons for failing of almost all clinical trials for AD therapy. Limitations due to preclinical models is one: though some drug candidates show certain signals of efficacy (or at least target engagement) in AD related transgenic animals, they turn out to be without any clinical benefits in patients. It is safe to conclude that animal models do not capture the complexity of AD pathologies, which are not exclusively related to A β or tau, but it includes cerebrovascular, metabolic and CNS innate immunity pathologies. Similarly, it has been pointed out that preclinical models do not faithfully mimic interactions between the main pathologies of the disease and processes underlying aging as observed in humans (Drummond and Wisniewski, 2017). Therefore, a better insight to AD pathologies based on novel findings in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics together with a better understanding of interactions between pathological neuronal activities and disease progression will identify novel, hitherto unrecognized drug targets. Other limitations relate to timing of intervention with therapy. Since there are no foreseen treatment options to restore or reverse neuronal death and large brain volume loss in AD patients, current clinical trials are recruiting patients at earlier disease stage, or even prodromal stage. Therefore, development of novel predictive biomarkers for both diagnostics of prodromal AD and disease progression will have a profound benefit for developing disease-modifying therapies. Similarly, better functional assessment of brain function is needed, either with validated neuroimaging or neurophysiological methods. These markers should be sensitive enough to detect subtle improvements in brain function which are not easily detectable by currently used clinical cognitive assessments. Recognized surrogate markers of efficacy, reflecting global brain function would support clinical trials by providing early signals if the tested therapy would lead to clinical benefits or otherwise."

    "introduction": "Microglia  are  immune  effector  cells  in  the  central nervous  system  (CNS)  and  play  an  important  role  in various CNS  diseases. 1 Specifically, microglia are resident macrophages in the CNS, accounting for about 20% of the brain's glial cells. 2 And, microglia utilizes its specific receptor repertoire to monitor the brain's microenvironment  dynamically, 3 protect  neurons,  and maintain  CNS  homeostasis 4 by  engulfing  and  clearing damaged neuronal debris and excess synapses. On the one  hand,  microglia  perform  a  protective  function  by phagocytosing and removing pathological protein aggregates. On  the other hand, they also play a deleterious  role  due  to  the  over-absorption  of  protein aggregates,  which  leads  to  impaired  phagocytosis  of microglia, causing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the infiltration of peripheral immune cells causes microglia to develop a pro-inflammatory phenotype, thereby accelerating disease  progression.  It  is  evident  that  microglia  play  a pivotal role in the regulation and impact of CNS diseases. Therefore, exploring microglia provides a credible evidence  base  for  understanding  the  pathogenesis  of CNS diseases and subsequent treatment of the diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and the most common type of dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive impairment. 5 The global prevalence of AD is expected to triple by 2050. 6,7 Multiple factors contribute to the development of AD, including amyloid deposition, hyperphosphorylation of microtubuleassociated protein tau (tau). Tau proteins, accumulation of apolipoprotein E, and neuroimmune  activation. 8 Specifically,  AD  is  characterized  by  the  extracellular deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins to form amyloid plaques and the abnormal aggregation of tau proteins 9 to form intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). These factors are evident to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.  In particular, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that most AD risk genes are highly or completely present in microglia. 10 This further suggests  that  microglia  play  an  important  role  in  the pathogenesis of AD. It  is  evident  that  an  in-depth  understanding  of  the mechanisms  of  microglial  cells  in  neurodegenerative diseases is of significant importance for the advancement of knowledge in the field of AD. However, the precise roles of microglial cells in the nervous system, including immune regulation, nutritional support, and clearance of metabolic  byproducts,  remain  unclear.  Their  aberrant activation is associated with neuroinflammatory responses, β-amyloid aggregation, and tau protein pathology. In particular, there is a paucity of comprehensive synthesis regarding the detailed mechanisms by which acupuncture modulates microglial cells  to  impact  the  pathogenesis  of  AD,  and  there  is  a dearth of theoretical support for acupuncture in modulating microglial cells to delay or treat  AD. Consequently,  the  present  paper  commences  with  a review of the diagnostic criteria for AD, the history of microglia  research,  and  the  lineage  of  development. Subsequently, the mechanisms of microglia polarization and neuroimmune inflammatory response, the bidirectional regulation of β-amyloid by microglia, the accelerated effect of tau protein diffusion due to microglia activation, and the microglia- apolipoprotein E (APOE) interaction are analyzed. Furthermore, based on the  results  of  cellular  experiments,  animal  studies  and clinical trials of microglia intervention and treatment of AD, the possible mechanisms of microglia-based treatment of AD are summarized in order to provide a scientific basis for the clinical application of acupuncture in  the  treatment  of  AD.  Finally,  this  paper  presents  a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms by which acupuncture  regulates  microglia  receptor  expression. These include the regulation of microglia activation to alleviate neuroinflammatory responses, Aβ overdeposition,  tau  protein  hyperphosphorylation,  and the pathology of APOE.",
    "conclusion": "Alzheimer's  disease  is  a  prominent  neurodegenerative disease that is considered a form of dementia in Chinese medicine. The World Alzheimer's Disease Report 2022 highlights  that  the  number  of  people  living  with  AD globally exceeded 55 million in 2019 and is projected to increase to 139 million by 2050. GWAS have shown that most  of  the  genes  associated  with  dementia  risk  are expressed  predominantly  or  exclusively  in  microglia, which have been found to be involved in the mechanisms of the disease's development. Acupuncture, as a Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy, has been well validated experimentally and clinically in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. An extensive  review  of  domestic  and  international  studies has revealed that acupuncture can slow  down  the pathological development of AD by modulating microglia  to  attenuate  neuroinflammatory  responses, reduce  Aβ  plaque  accumulation,  regulate  Tau  protein hyperphosphorylation,  and  influence  the  expression  of APOE. However, despite these encouraging findings, indepth studies are still necessary: firstly, further elucidation of the exact molecular mechanisms underlying  the  efficacy  of  acupuncture  is  needed,  and future research efforts should prioritize the regulation of signaling  pathways  and  key  protein  molecules  within microglia, as well as exploring the effects of acupuncture on APOE  gene expression and protein function; additionally, rigorous assessment  of  the  safety  and efficacy  of  acupuncture,  as  well  as  the  promotion  of microglia to a protective phenotype, should also be the focus of research. These efforts are expected to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of acupuncture in the  treatment  of  AD  and  provide  new  avenues  for therapeutic intervention."

    "introduction": "Acetylcholine (ACh) was the first neurotransmitter to be identified [1]. ACh  is  the  neurotransmitter  used  by  all cholinergic neurons, which has a very important role in the peripheral  and  central  nervous  systems.  All  pre-  and  postganglionic  parasympathetic  neurons  and  all  pre-ganglionic sympathetic neurons use ACh as neurotransmitter. In addition,  part  of  the  post-ganglionic  sympathetic  neurons also uses ACh as neurotransmitter. In  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS),  the  cholinergic neurons are widely distributed [2, 3]. They are mainly found in the spinal cord, hindbrain, medial habenula, mesopontine region, basal forebrain, striatum, olfactory tubercle  and islands of Cajella complex [2, 4-7]. Almost all regions of the brain are innervated by cholinergic neurons [3]. Given  its  widespread  distribution  in  the  brain,  it  is  not surprising  that  cholinergic  neurotransmission  is  responsible for  modulating  important  neural  functions.  The  cholinergic system  is  involved  in  critical  physiological  processes,  such as attention, learning, memory, stress response, wakefulness and sleep, and sensory information. Experimental data using non-human  primates  and  rodents  have  demonstrated  that injuries  introduced  to  basal  forebrain  cholinergic  neurons that  innervate  the  cortex  lead  to  attention  deficit  [8,  9].  On *Address correspondence to this author at the Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia,  ICB,  Universidade  Federal  de  Minas  Gerais,  Ave.  Antonio Carlos  6627,  Belo  Horizonte,  MG,  Brazil,  CEP:  31270-901,  Tel:  55-313409-2655; E-mail: fmribeiro@icb.ufmg.br the other hand, the facilitation of the cholinergic transmission by using the cholinesterase inhibitors can improve attention in humans [10, 11]. It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  cholinergic  system plays  a  role  in  the  learning  process  [12,  13].  Moreover, published data indicate that ACh is involved in memory [1416].  Further  studies  have  demonstrated  that  endogenous acetylcholine is important for modulation of acquisition [17], encoding [18], consolidation [19], reconsolidation [20], extinction [21] and retrieval of memory [22]. The importance of  the  cholinergic  neurons  from  the  nucleus  basalis  of Meynert  on  memory  is  highlighted  by  the  fact  that  the specific degeneration of these neurons takes place in Alzheimer's  disease  (AD)  and  contributes  to  the  memory loss exhibited by AD patients [23, 24]. Stress is  another factor  that  can regulate ACh release  in the forebrain and its function on the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) system can modulate biological and emotional  outcomes  [25,  26].  In  a  work  that  evaluated  the function of the cholinergic system in mediating the response to stress it was found that treatment of rats with the antagonist of  the  nicotinic  receptor,  mecamylamine,  attenuates  the activation  of  the  HPA  axis  in  response  to  a  stressor  agent [26].  Similarly,  nicotine  can  mimic  the  ACh  effects  on  the HPA axis by activating nicotinic receptors [27]. Another important function of the  cholinergic  system  is to regulate the sleep cycle [28]. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of  cholinergic neurons  in precise regions of the brainstem  can  promote  REM  (rapid  eye  movement)  sleep, dose-dependently [29]. Moreover, ACh has many modulatory functions  in  the  sensory cortex [30-32]. ACh contributes  to auditory synaptic transmission by facilitating thalamocortical communication [31]. In addition, ACh has a function in the organization and in the neuronal response to the visual cortex  [33].  Recent  evidences  also  suggest  the  involvement of ACh in adult neurogenesis [34].",
    "conclusion": "The cholinergic system plays an important role in memory  and  attention  and  the  loss  of  cholinergic  neurons from the nucleus basalis  of  Meynert  that  takes  place  in  the AD  patient's  brain  appears  to  be  a  very  important  factor contributing  to  AD  memory  deficit.  There  are  only  four drugs  that  have  been  approved  for  treating  AD  patients  so far, including the cholinesterase inhibitors -donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine - and memantine, which is an NMDA  receptor  antagonist.  However,  none  of  them  are disease-modifying  drugs.  Therapeutic  interventions  aiming to  replenish  lost  neurons  and/or  avoid  neuronal  death  have the potential to modify AD progression. Based on this idea, new drugs are being tested aiming to diminish A β production, increase trophic factors and decrease glutamate excitotoxicity. Such  therapies  have the potential to rescue cholinergic neuronal  death,  as  well  as  to  avoid  the  loss  of  cortical  and hippocampal neurons, preventing AD progression."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the leading neurodegenerative disease, is a major cause of dementia that occurs in the middle-aged and elderly population ( 1 ). As aging of the population intensifies, the disease's incidence increases yearly, seriously affecting the life quality of patients and their families ( 2 ). The pathogenesis of AD is complex and has yet to be fully elucidated. Hyperphosphorylated tau, β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, and neuroinflammation are considered core pathological factors ( 3,4 ). Over the past few years, research has focused on early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of AD ( 5 ). Immune therapy, and especially disease-modifying therapy, has played an essential role in disease prevention and treatment due to its unique target specificity. Along with the discovery of the intracerebral targets and biomarkers of AD, antibody-based drugs have shed new light on AD, and this is especially true since the approval of the monoclonal antibody (mAB) aducanumab for AD. As a highly homogeneous antibody produced from a single B cell clone, mAbs work at a specific epitope ( 6 ), which means they have a high level of target specificity. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a highly selective membrane barrier that prevents 98% of smallmolecule drugs and almost 100% of large-molecule drugs from crossing ( 7 ), poses a considerable challenge to drug development. Several reviews have discussed advances in research on mAbs against Aβ ( 8-11 ). However, new etiologic and pathological factors have been uncovered based on the Aβ hypothesis over the last two decades. At the same time, new strategies have emerged to bypass the BBB for better efficacy. Based on the pathogenesis and targets of AD, this review has summarized the intracerebral dysfunction of the disease, outlined the use of ADspecific mAbs, and discussed the strategies by which antibody drugs cross the BBB to treat AD.",
    "conclusion": "Over the past few decades, our understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and other related neurodegenerative diseases has improved significantly.  Nowadays, the higher incidence of AD and its impact on patients and their families has undoubtedly attracted more attention from researchers. Brain targets and biomarkers have been gradually discovered, significantly promoting the diagnosis and treatment of AD. mAbs have emerged as a promising tool for precisely binding drugs to their targets, blocking or modulating their effects, reducing the intensity of the immune response, and potentially eliminating the pathological process of AD. However, clinical trial data suggests that while these therapies can reduce AD-related markers such as Aβ, they do not consistently produce satisfactory clinical outcomes. This may be linked to the complex and incompletely understood pathology of AD. Recently, the question has been raised as to whether the priority of the Aβ hypothesis in the progression of AD needs to be reconsidered ( 45 ). Immunoprophylaxis is receiving more attention based on setbacks in immunotherapy. AD presents with intracerebral pathology, such as accumulation of Aβ, 20-30 years before the onset of cognitive impairment ( 186,187 ). Given the growing pathologic complexity of the disease, the clinical benefit that can be expected from Aβ-removing therapies alone is unclear at this point in time. Thus, targeting aberrant Aβ as immunoprevention is likely to be most successful when initiated during or prior to the stage characterized by the emergence and seeded propagation of aberrant Aβ and Aβ-associated pathologies ( 3 ). As anti-Aβ therapy, KHK6640, a novel anti-amyloid beta oligomer-specific antibody, tended to perform well in the treatment of patients included prodromal AD, with nonsignificant AIRA ( 188 ).  In contrast, anti-tau mAbs have made better progress. A phase 1 study demonstrated that atabecestat reduces Aβ isoforms and precursor protein (sAPPβ) in the CSF of patients with preclinical AD by an average of 67% ( 189 ). Semorinemab is safe but not effective ( 164 ). In addition, several trials on antibodies for AD are currently in the first phase to demonstrate the effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis ( 190,191 ). In addition, the existence of the BBB poses enormous challenges to AD treatment. Antibodies are highly attractive due to their target specificity, long serum halflife, precise mechanism of action, and limited target deficiencies, compared to small molecule drugs for treating neurological diseases. However, crossing the BBB and penetration efficiency is a major problem in developing monoclonal drugs for AD treatment. In addition, the efficiency of their penetration should not be overlooked. If the concentration of mAbs is too high in the periphery, this will cause adverse events such as AIRA. Therefore, in-depth pharmacokinetic studies are necessary. Researchers have proposed using bifunctional IgG fusion proteins, nanoparticles, and other methods to address these issues. Nasal administration has also been used to bypass hepatic first-pass metabolism and degradation by gastrointestinal enzymes. However, further clinical data on these approaches are needed. Although most therapeutic agents can prevent disease progression in preclinical studies, expected results were not yielded in clinical trials. Most drugs have only reached clinical phase 1 or 2 trials, and many of those that undergo phase 3 clinical trials are terminated due to poor efficacy. Although the FDA hastily approved aducanumab without conclusive clinical evidence, this may encourage patients with AD, indicating that drug development is advancing ( 192 ).  However, we must remember that there may be a long way to go. Funding : None. Conflict of Interest :  The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related neurodegenerative disorder with dementia. Currently, the estimated number of people living with this disease in the United Sates is 5.8 million, a number projected to increase rapidly in the coming years due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation and the lack of a cure [1]. In fact, the number of Americans age 65 and older is predicted to double from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million by 2060 representing a potentially substantial social and economic burden for the future society [1,2].

Declaration of interests The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. Clinically, AD is characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive functions. Early symptoms include difficulty recalling recent conversations, names or events. With the progression of the pathology, patients develop impaired communication skills, confusion, behavioral changes, poor judgment and often experience passiveness and depression [1,3]. The pathological hallmarks of this disorder are extracellular accumulation of amyloidβ (A β ) plaques composed of A β peptides, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein, brain inflammation and atrophy. These changes are thought to begin years before the clinical symptoms are noticeable [1, 3]. With the exception of the familial form which is the result of mutations on specific genes such as the A β precursor protein (APP), the presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 and which only account for approximately 2-4% of the total cases, AD is mainly a sporadic disorder whose etiology is currently unknown [4]. In fact, despite intensive research, the mechanisms responsible for A β accumulation and NFTs formation and deposition are not understood and there is not effective treatment for this condition. For this reason, in the past years several signaling pathways relevant to some of the pathophysiological processes have been investigated and evaluated as possible targets of novel therapeutic approaches for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a ubiquitously expressed and constitutively active serine-threonine kinase involved in the regulation of many key cell biology pathways, some of which have been also implicated in neurodegeneration. There are two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3α and GSK3β encoded by two different genes [5]. In the central nervous system (CNS), GSK3β is the most abundant and its expression levels are known to increase with age [6]. GSK3β is found hyperactive in the brain of AD patients and compelling evidence supports its contribution to AD pathology by distinct mechanisms [7]. Dysregulation of this kinase have been observed to affect both A β and tau metabolism and toxicity in vitro and in vivo AD models. Additionally, GSK3β activity has been linked to memory consolidation, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, long term potentiation and inflammation (Figure 1) [8]. Given the relevance of GSK3β signaling to the pathophysiology of AD, the therapeutic potential of its inhibition has been widely investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. This review will focus on GSK3β physiological function, current data regarding its aberrant activity in AD, and the evidence supporting the beneficial effect of GSK3β modulation as therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.",
    "conclusion": "In the past years, GSK3β has been recognized as an important key player in the AD pathogenesis. Since the initial discovery of GSK3β overexpression and overactivity in the CNS of AD patients, the role of this kinase has been extensively investigated in connection to tau and A β pathophysiology. As one of the main tau kinases, GSK3β promotes tau hyperphosphorylation and NFTs formation. Strong evidence has also pointed out that increased activity of GSK3β can induce A β formation through transcriptional regulation of BACE1 gene expression and through its regulatory function on PS1. Given the existence of sex differences in AD incidence, some studies have attempted to address the question on whether GSK3 β regulation is sexually dimorphic but all the current data available so far are not sufficient to conclude any significant gender-related effect on the activity of this kinase that could be relevant to the onset of development of AD pathology. In addition, recently GSK3β has been implicated in the modulation of synaptic plasticity, memory, neurogenesis and inflammation making GSK3β an excellent candidate as disease modifying agent for AD. However, current clinical research has failed so far to identify an effective and safe inhibitor of this kinase. GSK3β inhibition comes with many challenges related to its ubiquitous expression and multiple regulatory cellular functions. Future possible strategies aiming at bypassing the potentially serious off target effects should be to specifically direct GSK3β inhibition in the CNS and in the cells of interest. Therefore, given the promising preclinical studies, more research needs to be devoted to the development of selective and organ specific inhibitors that efficiently and safely regulate GSK3β activity in the CNS as a viable therapeutic approach to prevent or halt AD."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. It severely affects cognitive abilities of a person causing loss of memory and conscience. It is complex, unalterable, and progressive in nature. AD is the prevalent cause of dementia in late adult life and is linked with high morbidity and mortality rate in the elderly [1]. In 1906, the first case of AD was reported by a German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer after whom the disease is named [2]. It is associated with both genetic and environmental factors but the most prominent risk factor is age, and thus it is most prevalent in the older groups [3]. It is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases affecting around 40 million people around the globe and it is expected that more than 100 million people will live with AD by 2050. AD is a progressive and a devastating brain disorder that places a considerable financial burden on the government, families, and individuals. Some of the common symptoms of mild AD <!-- image --> include a decline in memory, change in personality, impaired reasoning, poor judgments, and inability to perform normal daily tasks, etc. [4]. The key clinical co-pathological indicators (Fig. 1) of AD are the formation of amyloid plaques or senile plaques formed through the accumulation of amyloids in extracellular regions while aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the intracellular regions form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in affected neurons [5]. Accumulation of amyloid plaques, which primarily contains amyloid beta 40/42 peptides, further leads to neuroinflammation and misprocessing of tau proteins. The MRI scan of the brains of AD patients shows shrinkage of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex regions in comparison to the normal brain (Fig. 1). AD can be classified typically into two types: sporadic and familial. Sporadic AD affects people above 65 years and is often referred to as late-onset AD (LOAD). Familial forms of AD are influenced by genetic factors and inheritance, the affected group lies between 30-65 years of age and is referred to as early-onset AD (EOAD) [6]. The Familial type of AD is originated through a rare autosomal dominant mutation occurring in three genes: Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) [7]. The majority of AD cases are sporadic and are driven by environmental factors and few genetic influences. A genetic risk factor found in sporadic AD cases through detailed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is the presence of epsilon 4 allele in Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4). The symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA-receptor antagonists, and combination therapy are currently approved strategies for AD. However, there are other mechanisms also that contribute to the pathogenesis of AD such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, hypoglycemia and vascular dysfunction, metal dyshomeostasis, protein misfolding, clearance of abnormal proteins, etc., and thus are the potential targets for the treatment of AD [8]. The new Fig. 1 Illustration  showing  the  comparison  between  the  brain  of  a healthy and an affected one <!-- image --> disease-modifying drug (DMF) strategies are emerging that target the pathogenic culprits of the disease i.e., extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in addition to other miscellaneous mechanisms. This brief review article is intended to review the approved symptomatic therapies, upcoming therapies targeting amyloids, tau proteins, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and miscellaneous targets.",
    "conclusion": "AD is a complex neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Numerous biochemical and pharmacological studies conducted in the past couple of decades have tried to unwind the complexities of this progressive disease. We now have a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD at the molecular level that has enabled the researchers to discover and develop novel therapeutic agents to treat this devastating disease. A number of therapeutics based on the identified targets were developed from 2010 to 2020 for the treatment of AD and several of these molecules are currently under investigation in clinical studies. Data indicated that over the last decade, the majority of the agents that reached in the phase 2 failed to show a drug-placebo difference and therefore could not make it to phase 3. On the other hand, more than 50 molecules successfully progressed from phase 2 to phase 3 but unfortunately, only one agent could pass the phase 3 clinical trial since 2003. Most of the studies were discontinued/terminated as these agents were found to be toxic and ineffective and thus failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints of the studies. In the ongoing clinical trials, anti-amyloid immunotherapy, Aβ aggregation inhibitors, BACE inhibitors, SALA (Selective Aβ 42 lowering agents), tau aggregation inhibitors, α-secretase enhancers, anti-tau immunotherapy and anti-inflammatory agents, etc., have exhibited encouraging results in the initial phases. However, the outcome of these clinical studies would shed more light on the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Currently, more than 140 drug candidates, mostly drug modifying agents, are being tested in various phases of clinical trials but it is yet to be seen how many of these would progress from the clinical testing phase to the clinical practice. In our opinion, newer therapeutic strategies to design, discover and develop anti-AD agents should focus on (i) repositioning and repurposing of existing drugs for AD; (ii) multitarget directed ligands capable of acting on multiple key molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of AD (iii) minimizing the toxicity of drugs failed in phase 3 (iv) improving the pharmacokinetic profile of the promising candidates by structural modification, (v) exploring the natural products to identify the lead molecule for AD, (vi) stem cell therapy, and (vii) identification of novel molecular targets including development of immunotherapy.

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pernicious neurodegenerative disease which is incurable with remedies developed up to date. The number of patients increases every year worldwide and 5.2 million people in the United States are suffering from AD. This number is expected to expand to 36 million to 115 million in worldwide around the year of 2050 and the estimated economic cost and suffering is increasing greatly (1, 2). Therefore, AD is seemingly insurmountable disease and the increasing numbers of patients produce diverse societal concerns in different aspects. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia caused by neurodegenerative process and is tightly related to amyloid β (A β ) and neurofibrillary tangles. The lack of early diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic remedy hinders the prevention of increasing population of AD patients every year. In spite of accumulated scientific information, numerous clinical trials for candidate drug targets have failed to be preceded into therapeutic development, therefore, AD-related sufferers including patients and caregivers, are desperate to seek the solution. Also, effective AD intervention is desperately needed to reduce AD-related societal threats to public health. In this review, we summarize various drug targets and strategies in recent preclinical studies and clinical trials for AD therapy: Allopathic treatment, immunotherapy, A β production/aggregation modulator, tau-targeting therapy and metabolic targeting. Some has already failed in their clinical trials and the others are still in various stages of investigations, both of which give us valuable information for future research in AD therapeutic development. Key Words: Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Beta-Peptides; Tau Protein; Immunotherapy; Glucose Metabolism; Aggregation etiology (4, 9). Disrupted synaptic plasticity, reduced dendritic spine density and memory impairment were proven in rodent model by extraction of A β oligomers from human patients (10). Senile plaques of amyloid β (A β ) in the brain parenchyma have been regarded as not only the main pathological phenomena (3, 4) but also the culprit of this disease according to amyloid cascade hypothesis based on molecular information found in AD study (5). Abnormal production and accumulation of A β in brain parenchyma result in AD pathologies through sequential events by aggregated forms of this protein and the amyloid plaque. A β is generated as a consequence of sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β - and γ -secretases (6-8). APP is first cleaved by either α - or β -secretase, and then, the remaining remnants of C83 or C99, respectively, are vulnerable to intramembrane proteolysis by γ -secretase. Amyloidogenic process of γ -secretase cleavage followed by β -secretase produces aggregation-prone A β which are in the center of AD Along with A β , microtubule-associated protein tau is another major factor of AD pathogenesis as a component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (11). Tau stabilizes microtubule protein and microtubule-associated processes in normal condition. During AD pathogenesis, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, aggregated and finally accumulated as neurofibrillary tangles (12). Tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation is tightly related to the existence of excessive A β and plaques, proving the tau pathology in AD (13, 14). Not only as axonal protein but also as regulator of dendritic function, tau plays a pivotal role, especially mediating early A β toxicity during AD progress (15). Therefore, inevitably, A β and tau became the main targets in drug development. Many clinical trials aiming these two proteins have been performed whereas several lines of targets are still under investigations. Up to date, only a few AD medications have been proved as improving AD symptoms, but none of them modify disease progress or pathological cascades (16). Researchers and clinicians suspect that the reason for many drug target candidates to fail in their clinical trials reside in the improper time of drug treatment, in fairly late stage of AD progression where irreversible damages have already occurred, including excessive A β deposits, neuronal impairment, death and blood brain barrier <!-- image --> Fig. 1. Diverse AD therapeutic strategies and their example chemicals tested in preclinical or clinical studies. APP , Amyloid precursor protein; A β , Amyloid β ; QC, Glutaminyl cyclase; AchEI, Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; nAchRc, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; 5-HT6 Rc, 5-hydroxytryptamine 6 receptor; NSAIDS, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; O-GlcNAc, O-linked β -N-acetylglucosamine; NButGT, 1, 2-dideoxy-2'-propylα -D-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]Δ 2'-thiazoline; HDAC, Histone deacetylation. <!-- image --> (BBB) disruption (17). Therefore, finding a diagnostic biomarker, especially for the early stages of AD pathology, is desperately needed for developing a valuable therapeutic target at the early stage and preventing progression of the disease. Diverse approaches for AD therapeutic strategy have arisen along with better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis. In Fig. 1 and Table 1, we listed possible strategies of drug development target based on accumulated scientific findings. In this review, we summarize the recent status of some AD drug targets using different strategies among them from published reports and ongoing clinical studies. In each category, we stated the representative drug targets, preclinical and clinical trials.",
    "conclusion": "Recent findings suggest that A β accumulation is fairly slow and time-consuming process, likely to require more than two decades (125). During this long process, more than one physiological system seems to be linked each other to harmonize in order to induce pernicious AD pathology. Taken information together, it is unlikely that a single remedy could cure AD because of its complexity and intricate relationship among the multitude of pathological components during pathogenesis. For this reason, therapeutic targets for AD should include multiple strategies and combinational remedy, not single, for the maximum effectiveness and better consequences. Also, not only direct therapeutic treatment for pathological intervention but also delaying this long pathogenic process would contribute to reduce the number of AD patients and increase prognostic benefit (26). Up to date, researchers are desperate to find new ways for AD treatment and tune the drug candidates for the maximum efficacies. For instance, in developing A β synthesis modulator as AD therapeutic target, researchers has to consider diverse questions and concerns, including the right margins of decreased A β production level, maintaining proper physiological level and off-target effects by influencing other substrates besides A β . Because it is hard to tune the enzyme activity within the right physiological catalytic range, the successful development of AD therapeutics with enzyme modulator is dependent upon its efficacy on aiming action, specificity and selectivity to target substrate. Also, as everyone agrees that the right timing of drug treatment is essential for the evaluation of efficacies for therapeutic targets, improvement in early diagnostic tool for AD have to be pursued along with AD therapeutic development."

    "introduction": "AD, which is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by deficiency in memory and cognitive functions. The predominant pathological changes of AD are development of A b plaques in specific brain areas, neurofibrillary tangles in neurons, and progressive loss of synapses and neurons (Ingelsson et al. 2004). Although the etiology mechanisms underlying these pathological changes are not clear yet, recent studies have shown deficits in the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is an important system to clear misfolded proteins or damaged organelles, is likely to precede the formation of A b plaques or neurofibrillary tangles (Correia et al. 2015). Until now, three types of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), have been identified in mammalian cells. Among them, macroautophagy is best studied and considered most relevant to AD, CMA has also been thought to play a role in AD. To make it simple, hereon we will refer macroautophagy as ''autophagy.'' In this review, we begin with the autophagy physiological machinery, evidence of autophagy malfunction in AD, relationship between autophagy dysfunction and AD-related pathology, and finally focus on the therapeutic potential of autophagy modulators.",
    "conclusion": "Although the etiology of AD remains unclear, and many factors including genetic mutation, environmental factors, imbalance of energy metabolism, and heavy metal ion (Yu et al. 2010; Li et al. 2010) seem to contribute to the etiology of AD, emerging advances regarding to autophagy have indicated its role as a protective factor in the early phase of AD, but an evil player in the late phase. Autophagy can influence the generation, secretion, and clearance of A b , and it will also influence the phosphorylation status and clearance of tau. Thus, chemical modulators of autophagy as well as gene therapy targeting autophagyrelated proteins offer great potential for the treatment of AD. A number of mTOR-dependent and independent autophagy modulators have been demonstrated to have positive effects in AD animal models and patients. However, a more throughout understanding of autophagy malfunction in AD, as well as brain pharmacokinetics of autophagy modulators will be critical for designing new experiments with appropriate drug doses in any future clinical trials for AD."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to progressive cognitive decline with pathological hallmarks of senile plaque and neuro /uniFB01 brillary tangle formation in the brain. In 1984, Glenner &amp; Wong discovered that the amyloid β protein (A β ) is the central component of extracellular amyloid plaques in AD. 1 Since then, A β has been considered as a driver of Alzheimer ' s pathological processes and the ' amyloid cascade hypothesis ' has become a leading theory of AD pathogenesis. 2 Over the past decades, targeting A β has been the main direction of developing AD treatment. 3 -6 However, the repetitive failures of A β -targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on this hypothesis. Anti-A β therapy has now become a signi /uniFB01 cant controversy in AD drug development and treatment. A β is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavage of β -and γ -secretase. However, the nonamyloidogenic pathway is the predominant pathway in vivo. 7 APP is mostly cleaved /uniFB01 rst by α -secretase within A β domain at the A β Leu 17 site in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, generating a secreted form of APP (sAPP α ) and an 83-amino acid membranebound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding A β production. The beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the β -secretase, and its homolog BACE2, the θ -secretase, also contribute to the non-amyloidogenic pathway. 7,8 Under physiological conditions, BACE1 predominantly processes APP at the A β Glu 11 β -secretase site to generate C89, and γ -secretase cleaves C89 to produce a truncated A β 11-40 . 7,8 BACE2 cleaves APP at the A β Phe 20 θ -secretase site to generate C80 and precludes A β generation. 9 -11 Two enzymatic cleavages of APP by BACE1 and γ -secretase are required to produce A β in the amyloidogenic pathway. BACE1 /uniFB01 rst cleaves APP at the Asp 1 site to generate sAPP β and C99. Subsequently, γ -secretase cleaves C99 to release A β and CTF γ . γ -secretase is a presenilins 1 (PS1)-containing macromolecular complex 12 -16 and this high molecular weight complex also requires nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective 1, and PEN-2 for its enzymatic activity 17,18 (Fig. 1). The balance between continual A β generation and ef /uniFB01 cient clearance is important for A β homeostasis to prevent its toxic aggregation into misfolded assemblies. 19 Similar to other brain metabolites, A β clearance depends on different pathways including enzyme degradation, crossing the blood -brain barrier (BBB), interstitial /uniFB02 uid (ISF) bulk/uniFB02 ow and CSF absorption. 19,20 The BBB is composed of endothelial cells connected by tight junctions to form a selectively permeable system. 21 The transport of soluble A β across brain endothelial cells to the peripheral circulation is mainly via low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1(LRP-1) and ABC transporter sub-family A and B member 1 (ABCA1 and ABCB1), 22,23 while receptors for advanced glycosylation endproducts (RAGE) is responsible for circulating A β entering into the brain. 24 It has been identi /uniFB01 ed that the expressions of the two blood ef /uniFB02 ux transporters LRP1 and ABCB1 were reduced during AD, whereas the expression of the blood in /uniFB02 ux transporter RAGE is elevated. 21,25 The perivascular drainage pathway plays a vital role in ISF bulk/uniFB02 ow clearance of A β . 26 Failure of perivascular drainage of A β altered A β homeostasis associated with synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment, leading to the development of AD. 27 CSF absorption clearance of A β depends on factors including CSF production by the choroid plexus, integrity of the blood-CSF barrier, relevant transporters and CSF lymphatic absorption. 28 In AD, the structural integrity of the blood-CSF barrier is destroyed, resulting in aberrant A β clearance. 29 Enzymatic pathways for A β degradation include the zinc metalloendopeptidases, insulin- 1 National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; 2 The Second Af /uniFB01 liated Hospital and Yuying Children ' s Hospital, Institute of Aging, Key Laboratory of Alzheimer ' s Disease of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; 3 Townsend Family Laboratories, Department of Psychiatry, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada and 4 Oujiang Laboratory (Zhejiang Lab for Regenerative Medicine, Vision and Brain Health), Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China Correspondence: Yun Zhang (zhangyun@xwhosp.org) or Weihong Song (weihong@wmu.edu.cn) Received: 5 February 2023 Revised: 5 May 2023 Accepted: 9 May 2023 Fig. 1 Amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing pathways of APP. In the amyloidogenic pathway, BACE1 /uniFB01 rst cleaves APP at the Asp 1 site to generate sAPP β and a 99-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C99. Subsequently, γ -secretase cleaves C99 to release A β and CTF γ . Under physiological conditions (non-amyloidogenic pathways), APP is mostly cleaved /uniFB01 rst by α -secretase within A β domain at the A β Leu 17 site, generating a secreted form of APP (sAPP α ) and an 83-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding A β production; BACE1 predominantly processes APP at the A β Glu 11 β -secretase site to generate C89, and γ -secretase cleaves C89 to produce a truncated A β 11-40; BACE2 cleaves APP at the A β Phe 20 θ -secretase site to generate C80 and precludes A β generation.

Down syndrome (DS) patients with trisomy-21 having extra copy of APP gene develop typical Alzheimer ' s neuropathology including amyloid plaques and neuro /uniFB01 brillary tangles. 35 -37 Mutations in APP, presenilin 1 ( PSEN1) and PSEN2 genes that increase A β production, elevate A β 42/A β 40 ratio and promote plaque formation cause autosomal dominant early-onset familial AD (FAD), implicating a role of altering APP processing in AD pathogenesis. 7,38,39 In contrast, an APP mutation identi /uniFB01 ed in the Icelandic population reduces A β production, leading to protection against cognitive decline in the elderly. 40 Both genetic (e.g., ApoE4, TREM2 ) and non-genetic (e.g. diabetes, obesity, stroke, or physical inactivity) risk factors for lateonset sporadic Alzheimer ' s disease (SAD) have also been identi /uniFB01 ed to increase A β generation and/or reduce A β clearance for its accumulation. 4,41 -45 These studies suggest that A β accumulation drives disease progression in both FAD and SAD and thus illustrates why clinical trials involving anti-A β therapies have garnered so much attention in the Alzheimer ' s community. Recently, A β -based therapy has received encouraging results. Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody against A β aggregates, has obtained the FDA ' s approval as an Alzheimer ' s drug for its ability to reduce the level of A β plaques in patients with early AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 46 -48 On Nov 30 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-releasedetails/lilly-shares-positive-donanemab-data/uniFB01 rst-active-comparator) announced the result of the /uniFB01 rst active comparator study (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4), which showed that donanemab, another monoclonal antibody targeting deposited plaques had outperformed aducanumab-avwa treatment in terms of brain amyloid clearance in patients with early symptomatic AD. 49 At the same time, results from the highly anticipated CLARITY AD study were published, showing that 18 months of treatment with lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting A β soluble proto /uniFB01 brils, reduced markers of amyloid and moderately improved cognitive decline in patients with early AD. 50 Recently, the FDA approved lecanemab as the second-ever monoclonal antibody to treat AD. ANAVEX ® 2-73 (Blarcamesine), which targets sigma-1 and M1 muscarinic receptors, has also demonstrated its diseasemodifying activity in AD transgenic mice (3xTg-AD), including reducing amyloid and tau pathologies as well as improving cognitive de /uniFB01 cits. 51,52 The results of its Phase 2B/3 study, presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer ' s Disease (CTAD) Congress 2022, showed that 48 weeks of blarcamesine treatment signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced cognitive decline in patients with early AD. This series of positive results offers a fresh hope and indicates that A β -based therapy may be indeed the right direction to be followed. In this review, we summarized the history and current understanding of the ' amyloid cascade hypothesis ' . In particular, we discussed the pitfalls, promise and important unanswered questions about the current anti-A β therapy, which will provide a foundation for further studying and developing more feasible A β -targeted strategies to optimize AD prevention and treatment.",
    "conclusion": "Since A β aggregates act as the unique speci /uniFB01 c pathological hallmark of AD and play a causative role in the disease development, they are believed as a promising target for Alzheimer ' s modi /uniFB01 cation. Most A β -targeting drug trials have failed as a consequence by lack of suf /uniFB01 cient speci /uniFB01 city and accurate translational models, loss of A β physiological homeostasis, and failure to be administered during the best therapeutic window. Nevertheless, learning from these failures will be bene /uniFB01 cial to the design of better therapeutic approaches. Biomarkers are needed for identifying patients with preclinical Alzheimer ' s disease so that treatment such as mechanism-based therapy could prevent or slow down the disease. Translational models and tools to mimic the nature of AD more closely are also required to bridge the gap between basic research and the clinical practice. Combination therapy that targets different mechanisms and pathologies would be directed by biomarkers and customized to the individual. We hope that these solutions could pave the way for exploration and development of more re /uniFB01 ned A β -based therapy for AD. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Brian J. Song ' s editing and comments.

    "introduction": "Rho GTPases are an important target in human diseases such as Alzheimer ' s disease (AD), cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological disorders, and cancers [1]. The various roles of Rho GTPases in AD pathogenesis have been extensively reviewed [2, 3]. It is widely known that AD pathology is characterized by the accumulation of β -amyloid (A β ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) [4], which leads to progressive loss and alterations in synaptic efficacy and damage at the synaptic terminal [5]. The dynamic regulation of actin polymerization plays a critical role in morphological changes in dendritic spines [6, 7]. The prominent regulators of actin polymerization are the Rho family of small GTPases that includes cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), and Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) [8, 9]. Rho GTPase activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that stimulate the release of GDP, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that promote the hydrolysis of GTP, and guanine nucleotide * Correspondence: aguilarb@ecu.edu; luq@ecu.edu 1 Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article <!-- image --> dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) that sequester the protein. Rho GTPases play critical roles in dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity [10, 11]. Aberrant activity of the Rho GTPases, their regulators (GEFs, GAPS, and GDIs), and effectors in AD has been reviewed [2, 12]. However, the therapeutic potential of Rho GTPases in AD remains unclear. This is due to the limitations of previous methods/technology and the variety of experiments/ models used to study Rho GTPases in AD. Herein, we summarize the fluctuating activity of Rho GTPases in various stages of AD pathogenesis and in several in vitro and in vivo AD models. The work discussed in this review serves as the foundation for Rho GTPases in AD, but a unified and more complete approach must be adopted to understand the intricacies of Rho GTPase signaling in AD.",
    "conclusion": "Overall, the studies discussed in this review highlight the critical functions of Rho GTPases in AD. Rho GTPases clearly play an essential role that appears to fluctuate during disease progression and/or location. These reports underscore the importance of Rho GTPases and reveal that our understanding of their roles in AD is still not complete. The use of more complete AD models (i.e., 3 × Tg-AD mouse model), specific assays that test for each Rho GTPase activation over time (i.e., 4 -18 months), and specifying the region of the brain (i.e., hippocampus and cortex) will help elucidate the role of Rho GTPases in AD. Further characterization of Rho GTPases and evaluation of Rho GTPase modulators will both define and fill an area of AD-related therapy that may ultimately lead to the development of novel pharmacological tools for future clinical trials."

    "introduction": "The  increasing  prevalence  of  central  nervous  system (CNS) disorders has largely been attributed to neurodegenerative  processes,  such  as  Alzheimer's  disease  (AD) [1]. AD is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline marked by symptoms  such  as  memory  loss,  linguistic  difficulties,  and agnosia, eventually leading to death. Although the etiology of AD remains a topic of ongoing debate, it is widely acknowledged  that  genetic  and  environmental  factors contribute  to  its  pathogenesis  [2,  3].  Patients  with  AD share common features, notably the progressive accumulation of misfolded proteins, including beta-amyloid (Aβ) [4],  tau,  or α -synuclein  [5,  6],  concurrently  occurring with neuronal death [7]. Several  biomolecules,  proposed  as  therapeutics,  are currently  approved  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  for  treating  AD,  mostly  through  the regulation  of  neurotransmitters  or  enzymes,  such  as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors[8], or by targeted inhibition  of  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptors [9].  However,  these  drugs  are  only  capable  of  providing temporary relief from symptoms of cognitive decline and do  not  address  the  underlying  root  cause  of  neuronal death [9, 10]. Therefore, immunotherapies have recently been  explored  as  alternative  approaches  for  treating the  early  stages  of  AD  by  removing  misfolded  proteins. Unlike other therapeutics that stimulate neuronal functions, immunotherapeutic drugs consist of anti-Aβ antibodies that specifically bind to Aβ, preventing aggregation  and  promoting  its  removal  from  the  brain  [11]. However, it has been repeatedly reported that the risk of adverse  effects,  such  as  amyloid-related  imaging  abnormalities (ARIA), increases with immunotherapy [12-14], and improvements are required for greater brain-targeting efficiency and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. The BBB usually acts as a highly selective physicochemical  barrier  to  the  systemic  delivery  of  therapeutics  [8, 15].  Consisting  of  pericytes,  neurovascular  endothelial cells,  and  astrocyte  endfeet,  the  BBB  protects  the  brain by  maintaining  homeostasis  through  the  strict  regulation  of  penetrating  solutes  that  circulate  in  the  blood [16,  17].  Thus,  most  therapeutic  molecules  with  molecular weights greater than 400 Da cannot cross the BBB, highlighting the need for a functional moiety for efficient drug delivery. Among the systemic delivery systems, nanoparticles,  liposomes,  and  exosomes  are  highlighted  for their biocompatibility and ability to cross the BBB owing to  their  phospholipid  bilayer  [18,  19].  Therefore,  these platforms have been utilized in recent studies as potential therapeutics for drug delivery to the brain, especially in AD [20-23]. In  this  review,  we  explore  the  potential  applications of  lipid-based  nanoparticles  (LBNs)  in  the  treatment  of AD.  Given  the  intricate  nature  of  AD  progression  and the current uncertainties in treatment pathways, we propose  hypotheses  to  elucidate  the  potential  mechanisms underlying  its  development.  In  addition,  we  investigate the  complexities  of  transporting  biomolecules  across the  BBB,  which  is  a  crucial  consideration  when  designing  effective  nanotherapeutics  for  the  treatment  of  AD. Finally, we clarify both the definition and recent advancements in utilizing LBNs, either as carriers for drug delivery or as therapeutic agents themselves, enhancing their potential in AD treatment approaches.",
    "conclusion": "The LBNs which could be classified into two major parts, exosomes  and  liposomes,  share  similar  characteristics in  terms  of  drug  delivery  systems.  Both  exosomes  and liposomes  have  been  remarkably  investigated  as  brain therapies due to their advantage of BBB penetration. In consists with the LBNs, among the various lipids, ionizable lipids has been also suggested as a potential candidate  for  enhancing  the  BBB  penetration  and  following brain  gene/drug  delivery.  Ionizable  LBNs  utilize  several strategies  including  prolonged  blood  circulation  time, increased  BBB  penetration,  and  promoted  interaction and uptake with brain endothelial cells through enhanced cellular  uptake  [198].  This  suggests  that  LBNs  can  act as carriers of drugs attenuating specific brain disorders. However,  the  ways  exosomes  and  liposomes  transpassing  the  BBB  and  curing  specific  neurodegenerative  diseases are different. Exosomes, derived from various types of cells, preserve most components of their parent cells. Such characteristics allow exosomes to be more biocompatible and less immunogenic. Also, recent investigations of  exosome  components  (e.g.  transmembrane  proteins, enzymes, and RNAs) have emphasized their roles in contributing AD pathology depending on the type of the parent cell of exosome. For instance, specific transmembrane proteins of the exosomes are known to enhance the brain (See figure on next page.)

Copyright 2020 Taylor &amp; Francis targeting  and  BBB  transcytosis  efficiency  towards  diseased sites [199, 200]. In addition, several beneficial miRNAs are proven to regulate AD pathological factors [167, 201]. However, the homogeneity of encapsulation of such naturally  synthesized  biomolecules  has  been  repeatedly reported, which presents a challenge for reproducibility. Furthermore, the lack of productivity and the high cost of production make it an uneconomical choice for clinical translation. In contrast, liposomes and other synthetic LBNs are artificially synthesized from chemically defined molecules,  thereby  addressing  the  challenge  regarding homogeneity  and  reproducibility [202].  Furthermore, versatile functionalization techniques of liposomes engineering  in  accommodating  hydrophilic  or  hydrophobic cargo  have  enhanced  in  vivo  drug  solubility  and  stability. As ongoing research, refinement and optimization of liposomes by surface modifications involving ligands and polymers  have  been  explored  and  shown  potential  for augmenting specific targeting and regulating drug release [202].  However,  as  a  synthetic  drug,  liposomes  exhibit higher immune response than exosomes and shorter circulation time, which requires further chemical consideration such as PEGylation [203, 204]. Recently,  hybrid  LBNs  are  recently  being  developed to  address  the  limitations  of  the  LBNs  and  combine such advantageous features of exosomes and liposomes [205-208].  For  example,  fusion  of  well-defined  synthetic  liposomes  and  naturally  secreted  therapeutic exosomes  may  offer  a  synergistic  approach  to  drug delivery systems. Due to the similar structure of those LBNs,  the  membrane  can  be  integrated  by  physical or  chemical  methods,  creating  a  new  LBN  containing the  original  cargos.  In  one  example,  CD47  expressing exosomes derived from transgenic fibroblasts were hybridized  with  heat-sensitive  liposomes.  The  hybrid LBNs presented advanced drug delivery to carcinoma, validating  potential  as  therapeutic  carriers  [205].  In another  experiment,  milk-derived  exosomes  and  pHsensitive  zwitterionic  liposomes  were  fused  to  treat Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This hybrid vesicle effectively targeted the jejunum while protecting cargo from gastrointestinal  pH  levels  and  mucus  adsorption  [209]. Thus,  the  combination  of  LBNs  offers  enhanced  drug stability  and  targeted-delivery  efficiency.  Similarly,  we Fig. 7 (See legend on previous page.) <!-- image --> could suggest therapeutic exosomes that lack of braintargeting  efficiency  being  utilized  in  AD  therapy  by fusion with liposomes conjugated with brain-targeting ligand.  Or  defined  cargos  within  liposomes  may  supplement therapeutic aspects of natural exosomes. Complementarily, components of exosomes could prolong  circulation  time  of  liposomes  through  enhanced biocompatibility and immunotolerance.  Along  with proteomic,  lipidomic,  and  genetic  investigations,  the efficacy  of  hybrid  LBNs  could  be  maximized.  Innovative approaches must be devised to unravel the intricate web  of  pathological  complexities  that  will  ultimately lead to enhanced treatment outcomes."

To date, there are no effective drugs to prevent or treat the cognitive decline in AD patients. Since the traditional drugs are ineffective in the treatment  of  AD  [5],  we  focus  on  the  gene  therapy  agents, which usually  consist  of  (1)  vectors  or  delivery  systems containing  engineered  genetic  constructs,  and  (2)  the active ingredients, i.e., DNA, RNA, genetically modified viruses, bacteria, or cells, which can replace, compensate, block,  or  correct  specific  genes  by  introducing  foreign genes into target cells or tissues to achieve the purpose of treating and preventing diseases [6]. As  one  of  the  common  types  of  genetic  medicines, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of non-coding small RNAs  with  a  length  of  about  22  bp  that  silence  target  genes  at  the  post-transcriptional  level  [7].  Current research  confirms  that  miRNAs  are  involved  in  many physiological processes and pathological pathways, including  embryonic  development,  tumorigenesis,  and cardiac  disease  [8-10].  Studies  have  confirmed  that  in the brain tissue or serum of AD patients, many miRNAs have been identified as down-regulated and thought to be involved in the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [11]. Some brain-enriched miRNAs, such as miR-124, miR-125b, and miR-132 [12-14], have been revealed to show therapeutic effects on AD. In our previous study, we investigated the changes of miRNA levels in serum of AD patients and found that miR-22-3p was significantly  down-regulated  [15].  Furthermore,  studies showed that miR-22-3p regulated the amyloid β (Aβ) deposition in mouse model of AD by targeting mitogenactivated protein kinase 14 [16], while miR-22 regulated the AD silence disease neuroinflammation [17]. To date, the  explicit  functions  of  miR-22-3p  remain  unclear,  in particular,  due  to  the  lack  of  transcriptomic  and  proteomic verifications of miR-22-3p and its mRNA. Therefore,  in  order  to  further  investigate  the  molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of miR-22-3p, we first confirmed the down-regulation of  miR-22-3p  in  brain  tissue  and  blood  of  AD  patients based  on  the  Gene  Expression  Omnibus  (GEO)  database (https://  www.  ncbi.  nlm.  nih.  gov/  geo/). Then, the effect of miR-22-3p on apoptosis of the Aβ-treated HT22 cells  was  detected  by  TUNEL  staining,  flow  cytometry, and  western  blotting.  The  APPswe/PSEN1dD9  (APP/ PS1) mice are widely used as animal models of AD [18]. The cognition of mice with stereotaxic injection of agomir or antagomir of miR-22-3p was assessed by Morris water maze test. Pathological changes in the mouse hippocampus  were  analyzed  using  hematoxylin  and  eosin (HE) staining, Nissl staining, and immunohistochemistry. Proteomics analysis was performed to identify the targets of miR-22-3p, and the identified targets were further validated  using  dual-luciferase  reporter  analysis  and  western blotting analysis. The results showed that miR-22-3P could  alleviate  apoptosis  of  the  Aβ-treated  HT22  cells and  improve  the  behavior  and  Aβ  deposition  in  mice, while  no  significant  effect  was  observed  on  neuronal loss.  Proteomics  analysis  revealed  the  regulatory  effects of miR-22-3p on the Sox9 protein, providing a significant potential for the development of new AD treatments.",
    "conclusion": "Our  previous  study  revealed  the  low  expression  of  miR22-3p  in  AD  patients,  while  our  current  study  investigated  the  role  of  miR-22-3p  in  AD  and  found  that  high expression  of  miR-22-3p  could  alleviate  cell  apoptosis and  improve  cognition  ability  in  AD  mice.  As  the  target of  miR-22-3p identified by proteomics analysis, the binding effect of Sox9 and miR-22-3p was also verified by the luciferase  experiments.  The  Sox9  was  further  confirmed to  be  involved  in  the  NF-κB  signaling  pathway.  To  conclude, microRNA-22-3p ameliorates AD by targeting Sox9 through the NF-κB signaling pathway in the hippocampus."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has remained incurable since its /uniFB01 rst discovery in 1906 [1]. An estimated one-third of AD cases may be associated with lifestyle or related attributes, education and other health conditions (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression) [2], although the exact interventions require clari /uniFB01 cation [3]. Mendelian randomization studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instruments suggest that apolipoprotein E, systolic blood pressure, smoking and vitamin D are inversely associated with AD [4 -6]. Effective therapies to prevent and treat AD were called for globally at the G8 dementia summit in 2013 [7], because of the escalating societal costs if AD remains untreated [8]. Effective drug treatments for AD have proved elusive. Current understanding of AD is based on factors identi /uniFB01 ed from brain autopsies, which in 1976 implicated acetylcholine, ' the Contents lists available at ScienceDirect",
    "conclusion": "Among the 67 genes found strongly associated with late-onset AD, this gene-based study replicated 12 genes and 7 gene clusters found by previous SNP-based GWAS and identi /uniFB01 ed 39 new genes (of which 4 genes were in strong linkage disequilibrium with previously known genes) and 2 new gene clusters (formed from 5 genes). However, we did not replicate 3 genes ( TP53INP1, IGHV1 -67, TPBG ) found by previous gene-based studies, possibly because the study of people of European ancestry in IGAP used Fisher's combination test [22], which is prone to type 1 error [33], and the trans-ethnic GWAS using the same GATES method may have identi /uniFB01 ed population-speci /uniFB01 c genes [23]. Moreover, our study suggests existing AD drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors or N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists) may not be targeting products of these late-onset AD genes, consistent with the previous comparison of AD genetic loci with approved AD drugs [21]. We also found that existing investigational AD drugs currently in Phase III trials (anti-A β agents, anti-tau agents, other neurotransmitters agonist/antagonists and insulin sensitizers) did not appear to be targeting products of late-onset AD genes. We cannot rule out the possibility that incomplete knowledge of AD genes and/or drug targets could generate such null /uniFB01 ndings. Finally, we found products of 11 AD genes are targets of existing drugs for other indications, which could possibly be considered for further scrutiny of directionality of disease genetics and drug actions within an integrated biological networks before re-purposing to mitigate or cure late-onset AD.

Cholinesterase inhibitors are not the only neurotransmitter related to AD [11] and may have missed the window of intervention in late-onset AD because of the accumulated loss of neurological functions [13]. N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists aim to oppose the effects of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate [34], however the causal role of glutamate in AD is yet to be elucidated [35]. The investigational drugs are mainly anti-A β and antitau agents, which are not known to target products of genes associated with late-onset AD, but are largely based on causal associations with familial AD. A β is the product of the APP gene which is primarily associated with early-onset AD [36] except for a rare genetic variant [37]. The latest failures of these drug classes in late-onset AD [38,39], have raised questions as to whether A β and tau proteins are biomarkers [15] or underlying causal targets [18]. The exact reasons for such an exceptionally high failure rate remains elusive, but several explanations have been proposed including: anti-A β trials have not reported changes in cerebrospinal /uniFB02 uid A β [40], results from animal models may not be comparable to human trials [41], clearance of existing A β protein may be as important as reduction in A β generation [42], and off-target

Notably, the possibility of citation bias in favour of the beta-amyloid hypothesis for AD has been raised [43]. We identi /uniFB01 ed 67 genes strongly associated with late-onset AD (12 genes from both approaches, 16 from SNP-based GWAS and 39 from the gene-based test). The 12 genes identi /uniFB01 ed by both approaches relate to lipid metabolism or transport (e.g. APOE, SORL1, ABCA7 ), synaptic function ( BIN1, PICALM, MA4A6A, PTK2B ), immune response ( CR1 , CD33, CD2AP ) or cell proliferation or apoptosis ( CLU, EPHA1 ) [44]. With replication by the gene-based test of /uniFB01 ndings from previous SNP-based GWAS, products of these 12 genes could possibly be potential drug targets. Conversely, 16 genes inferred from previous SNP-based GWAS as associated with late-onset AD were not associated with AD on the gene-based test, perhaps indicating that these SNPs might not indicate causal genes [27]. As such, considering genetic variants in functional units, i.e., genes, as here may be informative, in addition to considering single genetic variants. For genes with variants representing loss-of-function, drugs that activate (agonists) proteins in human cells would be needed, whereas drugs that inhibit (antagonists) would be needed for variants representing gain-of-function [25]. Understanding AD pathogenesis and drug actions are necessary for translating our genetic validations into identi /uniFB01 cation of therapeutic targets. Other identi /uniFB01 ed genes, if substantiated by future studies with clearly de /uniFB01 ned disease genetics and drug actions, could provide new, promising directions for late-onset AD therapeutic investigation. For example, NECTIN2 relates to cell-to-cell spreading of the herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, when herpes simplex virus type 1 is thought to play a role in AD [45]. A recent drug trial targeting the virus (VALZ-PILOT) has been launched, although it is not known to target products of the 67 identi /uniFB01 ed late-onset AD genes [46]. Further, the 9 gene clusters identi /uniFB01 ed by the genebased test and/or SNP-based GWAS could be potentially relevant genetic loci implicated in late-onset AD. The APO gene cluster (lipoprotein metabolism) consistently identi /uniFB01 ed by both approaches may play a causal role. Particularly the APOE gene, as substantiated Table 3 Genes strongly associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease with products targeted by existing drugs a . | Drug                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Target Gene   | Gene P-value   | Class                                                           | |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------| | Afatinib                                                                                                                                                                                                 | HBEGF         | 1.83 × 10 - 06 | Anti-cancer EGFR inhibitors                                     | | Brigatinib Cetuximab Erlotinib Ge /uniFB01 tinib                                                                                                                                                         |               |                |                                                                 | | Panitumumab Glatiramer acetate                                                                                                                                                                           | HLA-DQA1      | 9.36 × 10 - 07 | Immunomodulator for multiple sclerosis                          | | Apolizumab                                                                                                                                                                                               | HLA-DRB1      | 8.77 × 10 - 05 | Anti-cancer immunomodulator                                     | | Vandetanib                                                                                                                                                                                               | EPHA1         | 7.57 × 10 - 10 | Anti-thyroid cancer EGFR, RET tyrosine, VEGFR kinase inhibitors | | Copper Zinc                                                                                                                                                                                              | CLU           | 5.91 × 10 - 16 | Metal compounds                                                 | | Le /uniFB02 unomide Omalizumab                                                                                                                                                                           | MS4A2         | 4.47 × 10 - 09 | Anti-IgE for severe allergic asthma                             | | Alacepril                                                                                                                                                                                                | ACE           | 0.01           | Anti-hypertensive ACE inhibitors                                | | Deserpidine Enalapril Enalaprilat Fosinopril Fosinoprilat Gemopatrilat Imidapril Indolapril hydrochloride Libenzapril Lisinopril Moexipril Pentopril Perindopril Pivopril Quinapril Quinaprilat Ramipril |               |                |                                                                 | | Copper                                                                                                                                                                                                   | APOE          | 0              | Metal compounds                                                 | | Gemtuzumab ozogamicin                                                                                                                                                                                    | CD33          | 8.09 × 10 -    | Treatment for acute myleoid leukemia Nutraceuticals             | | Curcumin                                                                                                                                                                                                 |               | 07             |                                                                 | |                                                                                                                                                                                                          | APP           | 0.08           | extracted from tumeric                                          | by a Mendelian randomization study on apolipoprotein E [4], which has long been considered as a drug target [47]. Recently, APOE ε 4 alleles have been shown to promote a gain of toxic effects by independently promoting A β and tau protein production in human neurons [41]. Taken together with the null /uniFB01 ndings from randomized controlled trials of statin on cognitive functions [48] and Mendelian randomization studies of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [49] and triglyceride [50] on late-onset AD, better understanding on the functionality of both gene and gene clusters would add more nuanced mechanistic insights on lipid metabolism e.g. apolipoprotein E as a cholesterol transport protein may be more relevant than cholesterol synthesizing proteins. Importantly, this study identi /uniFB01 ed products of 11 late-onset AD genes that are currently targeted by other therapies [51 -53] that could possibly be further investigated to clarify the disease genetics and drug actions before repurposing for late-onset AD. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, which targets CD33 gene products, is an approved treatment for acute myeloid leukemia and has been considered for repurposing in AD [54]. Omalizumab, which targets MS4A2 gene products and another gene ( FCER1A ), is a subcutaneous injectable controlling moderate-to-severe allergic asthma; Le /uniFB02 unomide, which targets PTK2B gene products in addition to 2 other genes ( AHR, PTK2B ), is an orally-administered immunosuppressive diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drug. These existing drugs already have phase II trial results such that pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, preclinical effects in vitro and in vivo and phase I safety and dosage results are known, which reduces the risk, time and resources needed for possible drug re-purposing after more scrutiny of their relevance to AD. Our /uniFB01 ndings provide an initial step in translating AD genetics to therapeutic targets and should be enriched using network medicine by characterizing any drug actions within biological networks. Given many diseases including late-onset AD may be related to functional disruption of multiple genes rather than single genes and these genes may cluster and interact as disease modules, network medicine may help integrate regulatory networks, RNA networks, protein-protein interactions and metabolic pathways to delineate the complex links from disease genes to drug targets [55]. Moreover, disease proximity and similarity between two different drugs might indicate shared mechanisms between two diseases with implications for drug re-purposing [56]. Drugs may target speci /uniFB01 c but not entire disease modules [56] and may partly inhibit or activate interactions and functions [57], thereby AD drug targets are not necessarily the products of AD genes. In addition, only a fraction of proteins (gene products) can be manipulated by small molecule drugs [57]. Clarifying the direction of drug actions as well as the drug effects within integrated biological networks would help identify gene products as druggable targets. As such, building and integrating drug-drug relationships, geneprotein interactions, and disease-disease networks may provide a framework for further identifying drug targets [58]. Further, the use of computational drug-target interactions may help predict druggability by integrating genomics, pharmacological properties, biochemical interactions supplemented with similarities between drugs and target proteins [59]. Although the network-based analytical techniques are evolving and the interactome and drug-protein interactions remain to be fully understood, to date, network-based analysis using GWAS data has contributed in prioritizing disease genes by mapping candidate genes within the protein-protein interaction network [60] supplemented by further searches of subnetworks [61]. Speci /uniFB01 cally for AD, Talwar et al. (2014) found 6 gene clusters related to 7 proteins encoded by genes EGFR , ACTB , CDC2 , IRAK1 , APOE , ABCA1 , AMPH with EGFR and ACTB as key genes [62]. Browne et al. (2015) found 32 prioritized AD genes with PSEN1 and TRAF1 as key genes [63]. Both studies identi /uniFB01 ed AD genes primarily related to neurogenesis and its regulation based on functional annotation using gene-ontology [62,63]. Hu et al. (2017) found 3 main modules related to neuronal pathways and metabolism, cell growth or survival and neuroendocrine, and immune response using pathway crosstalk analysis [64]. Given these previous studies only considered AD genes as a whole, our systematically identi /uniFB01 ed late-onset AD genes could be utilized for lateonset AD-related gene cluster identi /uniFB01 cation and functional annotation. Mostafavi et al. (2018) found INPPL1 and PLXNB1 related to late-onset AD using RNA sequencing from a cohort of 478 older adults with brain autopsy [65]. While these previous networkbased studies do not replicate in their most relevant genes, two of these genes ( ABCA1, INPPL1 ) are paralog of genes identi /uniFB01 ed in our study ( ABCA7, INPPD5 ). Alternatively, comparison of gene expression pro /uniFB01 les and drug-induced RNA expression pro /uniFB01 les could provide further insights to connect genes to existing drugs [66,67]. Issa et al. (2016) found several approved or experimental drugs (such as Rasagiline, Interferons, Calcium, Dovitinib, Somatropin Recombinant) related to AD [68]. Vargas et al. (2018) found 6 approved drugs (Cefuroxime, Cyproterone, Dydrogesterone, Metrizamide, Trimethadione, Vorinostat) negatively associated with AD [69]. Both studies used disease-related gene expression from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, but applied to different drug-induced expression pro /uniFB01 les, which might account for the differences in the identi /uniFB01 ed drugs [68,69]. The late-onset AD genes and existing drugs for other indications identi /uniFB01 ed in this study would allow more re /uniFB01 ned comparison of expression pro /uniFB01 les in future studies for drug repurposing, of which timely evidence is needed considering this study identi /uniFB01 ed that current approved and investigational AD drugs may not be targeting late-onset AD genes. This systematic and agnostic identi /uniFB01 cation of genes for late-onset AD provides directions for re-thinking AD treatments. Nevertheless, several limitations are noted. First, the genes identi /uniFB01 ed here from IGAP relate to late-onset AD. As such, they may not be relevant to early-onset AD, i.e., AD occurring before the age of 65 years, which may explain the non-identi /uniFB01 cation of the 3 genes ( APP , PSEN1 , PSEN2 ) associated with early-onset AD [36]. Although a rare variant of APP might be related to late-onset AD as well, but is likely context-speci /uniFB01 c as it has been found in Nordic countries whereas it is very rare in the United States [37]. Second, the genes identi /uniFB01 ed might not be a complete set and did not include genes on the sex chromosomes. Replication of the gene-based test in a different population or using a future GWAS with a larger sample size may reveal additional genetic targets. The recent trans-ethnic GWAS for AD using a gene-based test with the same GATES method identi /uniFB01 ed 8 late-onset AD genes, of which nearly all genes ( CR1 , BIN1 , PTK2B , CLU , PICALM , and ABCA7 ) were also identi /uniFB01 ed in our study. The only new gene ( TPBG ) that study identi /uniFB01 ed was neither found in the previous GWAS of European ancestry [26] nor reached genome-wide signi /uniFB01 cance in their European ancestry-speci /uniFB01 c result [23], indicating the relevance of certain genes may be population-speci /uniFB01 c. Nevertheless, consistency in genes identi /uniFB01 ed in both trans-ethnic GWAS and our study with a larger sample size and greater power without excluding SNPs with P -value b 1 × 10 -5 lends credence to the genebased association approach. Third, this study aims to identify potential genetically validated drug targets rather than map out the full genetic functionality or pathophysiology of these targets, because repurposing therapies acting on genetically validated targets may be the swiftest way of developing effective new treatments. We acknowledge that the current gene-based analysis might not provide comprehensive therapeutic effects and AD pathogenesis. Comparing disease gene-related and drug-induced gene expression pro /uniFB01 les may provide further insights [66]. Fourth, our identi /uniFB01 ed drug targets depend on the validity and completeness of KEGG, Drugbank and Drug Repurposing Hub. While the Drug Repurposing Hub incorporates extensive in-house drug target data, more publicly available data from pharmaceutical companies would make the search more comprehensive especially for investigational drugs [70]. Moreover, these curated cross-references are constantly being made more comprehensive to re /uniFB02 ect new discoveries, so it is possible that new targets will be found in the future. Fifth, some valid targets of existing drugs might not reach genome wide signi /uniFB01 cance. For example the gene related to statins ( HMGCR) [71] is only nominally ( P -value = .004) associated with ischemic heart disease [72]. Sixth, the genebased test considers SNPs within or near the genes using the same amount of SNPs as the SNP-based GWAS, but not intergenic regions [33]. Our /uniFB01 ndings can be supplemented by future studies identifying SNPs outside of genes associated with late-onset AD to provide a comprehensive AD genome. Seventh, this study considers genes reported based on index SNPs to allow comparison with previous AD GWAS [26]. However, SNP-based GWAS identi /uniFB01 es genomic regions (loci) which may correspond to multiple genes that do not necessarily correspond to the genes implicated in late-onset AD [73]. Consideration of multiple genes within the loci given in a recent review of GWAS of late-onset AD [73] identi /uniFB01 ed 4 more genes ( HLA-DQA1, MS4A4A, MS4A6E, MS4A2 ) using both approaches. Our gene based test identi /uniFB01 ed 35 genes not found by previous SNP-based GWAS. Finally, case-control studies of older people are inevitably open to selection bias, meaning that genes lethal for other diseases may appear relevant to late-onset diseases [74]. However, the genes we identi /uniFB01 ed are not associated with major diseases that may result in death before the onset of AD, such as ischemic heart disease [72] or stroke [75]. In conclusion, our study provides no evidence that approved and investigational AD drugs are targeting products of genes strongly associated with late-onset AD, which might explain the lack of ef /uniFB01 cacy to date. Genetic validation of potential AD drugs might help to identify the most promising drugs to try to combat AD, conversely a genebased test may also provide an initial screening tool to identify drugs that are unlikely to be successful. Other drugs targeting products of late-onset AD genes do already exist, but the mechanisms of disease genetics and drug actions need further clari /uniFB01 cation before proposing drug targets to combat late-onset AD."

The clinical symptoms of AD patients mainly include cognitive dysfunction and memory loss [3]. Most AD cases have  an  onset  after  65  years  of  age,  accounting for 5%-10% of this age population, and this number increases  to  50%  in  people  older  than  85  years  [4].

According to the current theories, AD pathologies are driven by both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. The modifiable risk factors include, but are not limited to, disorders such as diabetes,  hypertension  and  cardiovascular  diseases,  and an unhealthy lifestyle also raises the risk of disease. Aging and genetic factors, such as the apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene,  are  the  main  non-modifiable  risk  factors  for  AD [6-9]. Current  commonly  used  drugs  for  AD,  mainly  cholinesterase  inhibitors  and  N-methylD -aspartate  receptor  antagonists,  are  symptomatic  and  still  not  effective in curbing the disease progression [10, 11]. Much effort is  needed  to  develop  therapeutic  methods  for  AD.  The © The Author(s) 2022.

According  to  the  Aβ  cascade  hypothesis,  some researchers  believe  that  active  immunization  with  vaccines  or  passive  immunization  with  specific  antibodies that  aims  to  promote  Aβ  clearance  is  promising,  while others hold the opinion that targets beyond Aβ, such as tau,  are  imperative.  In  addition,  some  microglia-based immunotherapies targeting various immunological molecules such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2  (TREM2),  CD38  and  Toll-like  receptors  (TLRs) are under investigation as well [12-15]. Both active  and  passive  immunization  strategies  have advantages.  Active  immunotherapy  (vaccines)  depends on  the  cellular  and  humoral  immune  responses,  resulting  in  long-term  generation  of  endogenous  antibodies. Compared  with  passive  immunotherapy,  active  immunotherapy produces high-concentration antibodies in the human body, with few injection times and less medical cost.  On  the  other  hand,  passive  immunotherapy  (antibodies) is regarded more suitable and effective for elderly patients  whose  responsiveness  to  vaccines  is  reduced. Furthermore,  upon  occurrence  of adverse reactions, the  effects  of  humanized  monoclonal antibodies can be stopped more conveniently than vaccines due to the targeting  of  specific  protein  conformations.  However,  passive  immunization  requires  repeated  dosing  and  more expenditure.  In  addition,  both  approaches  may  induce over-activation  of  the  innate  and  adaptive  immune  systems, resulting in side effects such as cerebral vasculitis [16].  In  this  review,  we  introduce  immunotherapeutic strategies that have already been approved or under clinical  trials,  discuss  their  mechanisms  of  action,  and  propose the perspectives and challenges of immunotherapies for AD.",
    "conclusion": "Although  the  FDA  approval  of  aducanumab  has  drawn controversy, it cannot be denied that this human monoclonal  Aβ  antibody  raises  the  possibility  that  AD  neurodegeneration  may  be  slowed  down  or  prevented  by Aβ clearance. Also, it will greatly promote research and development  of  other  AD  immunotherapies.  Research efforts are being made to overcome challenges in immunotherapy  for  AD,  including  target  selection,  adverse reactions, drug delivery and early diagnosis of AD, in the aim of developing more refined vaccines and antibodies. Resolution  of  these  challenges  would  pave  the  way  for generation of new immunotherapeutic drugs for AD."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranks among the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders [1]. AD is characterized by features,  including  memory  loss,  progressive  decline  in cognitive processing and reasoning, and a shift in personality and behavior, and has been established as the leading cause of dementia [2, 3]. Its pathological characteristics  mainly  manifest  as  the  accumulation  of extracellular  betaamyloid  (Aβ)  plaques  in  the  brain parenchyma and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein [4, 5]. Recent estimates suggest that over 55 million individuals  worldwide  are  afflicted  by  AD,  while  the precise  mechanisms  governing  its  pathogenesis  remain elusive [6]. Currently, there is no drug that can effectively reverse cognitive deterioration [7]. This devastating disease not only inflicts profound physical suffering upon patients but also imposes a substantial burden on families in  terms  of  caregiving  demands and  emotional distress, *Correspondence  should  be  addressed  to: Dr. Bing  Huang,  Shantou  University  Medical  College,  Shantou,  China.

Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms of this disease and developing effective therapeutic drugs are necessary. Cathepsins constitute a prevalent group of proteases in the endosome-lysosome system [9]. The etymology of 'cathepsin' traces back to the Greek word for 'digestion', and its  initial  usage  in  the  scientific  literature  was  first introduced by Willstätte and Bamann in 1920 [10]. Since then, the structural features, distribution, substrate affinities, and clinical significance of the cathepsin family have been extensively explored and documented. These enzymes are present in various cell types throughout the body  and  perform  crucial  functions  in  a  wide  range  of physiological processes, including digestion, blood coagulation, bone resorption, ion channel activity, innate immunity,  complement  activation,  apoptosis,  vesicular trafficking,  autophagy,  angiogenesis,  proliferation,  and metastasis [11]. Recent studies have highlighted the significant contributions of the cathepsin family to the pathogenesis of AD. For instance, cathepsin X (CTSX) participates in the regulation of microglial function, which  affects chronic  neuroinflammation  in  the  brain  and  mediates neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [12]. Besides, an  increase  in  the  activity  and  expression  levels  of cathepsin B (CTSB) was found to correlate with increased amyloid plaque deposition [13]. Additionally, cathepsin D (CTSD),  the  predominant  Aβ -degrading  protease,  has been implicated in the formation of NFTs [14]. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of the cathepsin  family  as  a  promising  therapeutic  target  in patients  with  AD.  In  this  review,  we  systematically demonstrate the biological properties, structure, and functions of most cathepsins and present their regulatory roles in the progression of AD, offering valuable insights for the future treatment of AD. Figure 1 Classification and Structural Schematic Representation of Human Cathepsins. The human cathepsin family comprises eleven  cysteine  proteases,  two  serine  proteases,  and  two  aspartic  proteases.  Cysteine  cathepsins  can  be  further  categorized  into endopeptidases, exopeptidases, aminopeptidases, and carboxypeptidases based on substrate specificity. Cathepsins exhibit specific amino  acid  numbers  and  domain  lengths,  crucial  features  for  understanding  their  functionality.  A  detailed  representation  of  the functional sequences of cathepsins is provided, including their domain composition (signal peptide, prodomain, and mature domain), along with corresponding amino acid numbers. <!-- image --> Table 1 .

    "conclusion": "In conclusion, our review has expounded on the multifaceted roles of several cathepsins, previously investigated  in  the  context  of  AD  pathogenesis  both  in humans and mice.  We have  demonstrated  their  diverse regulatory  abilities  in  AD  progression,  encompassing functions such as modulating the neuroimmune response, facilitating Aβ degradation, and influencing tau hyperphosphorylation, all of which are critically contribute to the brain damage and cognitive dysfunction. While our review has encompassed a wide spectrum of cathepsins,  it  is  evident  that  some  members  of  this essential  class  of  lysosomal  enzymes  warrant  further investigation. As research advances, the intricate interplay between  cathepsins  and  AD  is  becoming  increasingly unraveled, suggesting their potential as promising targets and biomarkers for early diagnosis and later drug development and treatments for AD (Fig. 7)."

    "introduction": "Alzheimer's  disease  (AD)  is  one  of  the  most  common and fatal neurodegenerative conditions in the world [1]. Over  50  million  people  worldwide  are  thought  to  have dementia [2]. More than 90% of all dementia cases on the globe  are  caused  by  Alzheimer's  disease  (AD).  AD  frequently includes behavioral and psychological problems [3]. The illness often affects persons over the age of 60 [4, 5]. However recent investigations have revealed that the pathological  alterations  in  AD  start  15  years  before  the development of clinical symptoms and that by the time the  diagnosis  is  confirmed,  irreversible  damage  to  the brain system has typically taken place [6]. Remembering loss and linguistic difficulties are signs of damage to the nerve cells  involved  in  thinking,  memory,  and  learning. The patient is unable to carry out regular tasks as a result, and gradually becomes  bedridden, which ultimately results  in  death  [7].  Moreover,  epidemiological  studies reveal that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is normally regarded  as  a  precursor  stage  of  AD.  Compared  to  the 1-2% conversion rate of AD in healthy aging, 10 to 15% of  people  with  MCI develop AD each year [8]. Most of the  cases-those  classified  as  late-onset  AD  (LOAD)occur  after  the  age  of  65,  whereas  those  classified  as early-onset AD (EOAD)-which account for less than 5% of all cases-occur before the age of 65 [7]. EOAD, which is thought to account for between 5 and 10% of cases of AD, has been reported more frequently recently [9]. Major risk  factors  for  the  condition  include  smoking, vascular problems, old age, head trauma, family history, inadequate physical activity, and environmental variables [10]. However, the diagnosis of EOAD is more challenging, frequently requires a longer time between beginning and  diagnosis,  and  requires  the  use  of  further  imaging and laboratory tests to find signs of pathological changes to  support  the  AD  diagnosis.  Early  detection  of  AD  is, therefore, essential for the detection and treatment of the disease  [11].  Furthermore,  understanding  the  causes  of illness initiation and progression is a requirement for the creation  of  drugs  that  treat  the  disease.  In  this  respect, amyloid  beta  (Aβ)  peptide-containing  senile  plaques, hyperphosphorylated arrangements of the microtubuleassociated  protein,  i.e.,  tau  protein  in  neurofibrillary tangles  (NFTs),  and  neuroinflammation  that  results  in neurodegeneration are the pathological characteristics of AD [12]. NFTs and Aβ plaques, which are produced by aberrant intracellular tau protein phosphorylation aggregation, are the two primary clinical hallmarks of AD [11]. On  the  other  hand,  the  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB) consists  of  3  cellular  components:  (1)  endothelial  cells, (2) astrocyte end-feet, and (3) pericytes (PCs). The bulk of  blood-borne  substances  are  prevented  from  entering the brain by the diffusion barrier that is generated by the tight  junctions  (TJs)  between  the  cerebral  endothelial cells [13]. A variety of neurologic diseases, such as stroke and neuroinflammatory disorders, are made more complicated by BBB dysfunction, which, for instance, impairs the  TJ  seal  [13].  The  costs  of  treating  the  condition  are rising as the number of AD cases rises [14]. It is astounding  how  much  the  public  health  system  and  caregivers  are  affected.  The  disease  disproportionately  impacts women and frequently serves as the primary caregiver for loved  ones  who  have  AD.  Approximately,  70%  of  those who care for AD patients and dementia are women [7], and research statistics show that depression affects 65% of caretakers [15]. There are currently few clinically effective disease-modifying therapies for AD, the most prevalent basis of dementia [16]. Disease-modifying medicines that may stop or decrease the progression of the disease are desperately needed, but sadly, none are present at this time. A never-ending string of failures of mid- to late-stage clinical trials has plagued the  history  of  AD  medication  development.  However, tremendous progress has been made lately in elucidating essential elements of the underlying pathobiology of AD. New therapy approaches are still being actively explored and tested even if  the  therapeutic  pipeline  has  encountered difficulties, and several pharmaceutical companies have chosen to shutter their AD medication development sections.  Recently  Lecanemab  is  introduced  for  early stage  AD.  In  a  placebo-controlled  study,  it  decreased amyloid  markers  in  early  Alzheimer's  disease  and  produced a somewhat less severe loss on cognitive and function  assessments.  To  ascertain  lecanemab's  safety  and effectiveness  in  the  early  stages  of  AD,  longer  trials  are necessary [17]. Lecanemab received its first approval for AD on 6 January 2023 in the USA under the Accelerated Approval  Pathway.  It  is  further  undergoing  regulatory review in the EU, Japan, and China, with clinical development proceeding in several other countries around the globe [18]. Based on the preceding discussion, this review outlines treatment options, obstacles, and opportunities on  the  road  to  developing  disease-modifying  medications. It also discusses recent developments in our understanding of the pathobiology of AD.",
    "conclusion": "The potential  of  nanotechnology  in  the  development  of efficient, secure, and BBB-penetrating nanodrugs for the management  of  numerous  central  nervous  system  disorders  deserves  acknowledgment.  Utilization  of  nanoparticulate  devices  to  overcome  BBB  offers  significant benefits, which are further augmented by the noninvasive method of drug delivery, enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and diminished occurrence of undesirable consequences. The potential of utilizing receptor-mediated transcytosis for the delivery of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic molecular probes that can cross the BBB has been examined in this  context.  For  example,  previous  studies  have  shown evidence that nanocarrier structures coated with PBCA polymer  can  effectively  transport  contrast  compounds that are impermeable to the blood-brain barrier BBB for neuroimaging."
